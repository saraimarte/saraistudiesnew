One application of integrals is finding the area of the region between two curves from one point to another.

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "Area Between Curves Formula"/>

Alrighty, so the acronym I have for you guys is **FITS!**

F - Formula  
I - Intersection (gets the bounds)  
T - Top/Bottom? (finds what is f(x) & g(x))  
S - Solve Integral

Let's try it out!

Find the area of the region bounded by y = 2-x<sup>2</sup> and y = -x by integrating with respect to x.

<Solution>

First, "with respect to x" just means everything needs to be in terms of x, like the bounds and the equations. And they are! So you're good.

Find the area of the region bounded by integrating with respect to y.

<Solution>

First, "with respect to y" just means everything needs to be in terms of y, like the bounds and the equations.

</Solution>

Find the area of the region enclosed by y = x<sup>4</sup> and y = 8x.
