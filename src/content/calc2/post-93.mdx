# What is a series

A series is just the sum of a sequence.

In other words, you are adding up all the terms in a sequence.

# Notation

To understand where a sequence is heading- where it's being limited to- we take its limit as the numbers in the sequence go on forever, checking if they settle around a particular value.

When we look at a series—meaning the sum of a sequence—we want to see where the sums are heading-what they are being limited to. To do this, we add the terms of the sequence **one by one, little by little**, creating a new sequence of these **partial** sums called S<sub>n</sub>.

Then, we find the limit of this sequence of partial sums to see if it’s approaching a specific value- a specific sum.

So, if a sequence is: a<sub>n</sub> = `{1, 2, 3...}`

To find the series you take the partial sum at every n and dump that into the sequence of partial sums called s<sub>n</sub>.

It's called partial sums because you will notice we take the sum one n at a time- partially.

s<sub>1</sub> = 1 = 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; so, &nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = `{1, ...} `  
s<sub>2</sub> = 1 + 2 = 3 so, &nbsp; &nbsp;S<sub>n </sub> = `{1, 3, ...} `  
s<sub>3</sub> = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 &nbsp;so, &nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = `{1, 3, 6 ...} `

then the series is: &nbsp; s<sub>n</sub> = `{1 + 3 + 6...}`

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; s<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp; s<sub>3</sub>

So, if I ask you:**What is S<sub>3</sub>?** You say 6 because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6

I'm really asking what is the partial sum of a<sub>n</sub> up until n = 3.

In sigma notation, I'm really finding:

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  <img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" src={img2.src} alt="" />
</div>

That is what we call a finite series because it is the sum up until a certain Number.

## How do we find the sum of the _whole_ sequence?

But if the goal is to find the full sum of the sequence a<sub>n</sub> then that's going to take forever. Because a sequence will go on forever and so will I have to sit here and find the partial sums for forever. Imagine if I had to find S<sub>100000</sub>, we don't have all day. So what do we do?

We literally take the sum of the sequence from a starting point to infinity.

<div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap: 20px; flex-wrap:wrap" >

So, instead of finding the sum of the sequence from one point to another finite point n,

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img1.src} alt="" />
</div>

We can find the sum of the sequence from one point to infinity.

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  <img loading="lazy" src={img3.src} alt="" />
</div>

</div>

but remember infinity is not a number, so we're really trying to find the sum of the sequence as it approaches infinity.

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img4.src} alt="" />
</div>

and so another way to write that is, 

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
<img loading="lazy" src={img25.src} alt="" />
</div>

and that is the sum of the sequence of partial sums as n gets infinitely bigger... aka the series.

So, if the sequence of partial sum (S<sub>n</sub>) converges then the series converges (because the "series" is the same as the "sum of the sequence of partial sums (S<sub>n</sub>) as n (the sums) go to infinity").

We call this an infinite series.

This tells us that to find if a series converges we really just need to find if the sequence of partial sums (S<sub>n</sub>) converges.

## What do we care about?

As the last lesson, there are only three things we care about, if a series converges, diverges and if it converges what does it converge to?

### How do we know when a series converges or diverges?

First, we have two special types of series that when we know something about them, we can conclude they converge _and_ what they converge to.

Those are telescoping and geometric series. Those we will go over first.

Second, we will then move onto harder series where we will not be able to find what it coverges to if it does converge _and_ we will need to use tests to test for convergence.

### How do we know what a series converges to, if it converges?

We will only be able to find out what a series converges to if we're dealing with telescoping or geometric series (10.2) because either we can find it manually (telescoping) or we have a formula for the sum (geometric). After 10.2, we will only be able to tell if the series converges or not.

Usually, we cover special stuff at the end of the chapter. This time, we'll cover the special series at the beginning.

# Special Series

## 10.2 Geometric Series

<Rulebox>

**Rule:**

If |r| < 1 CON  
If |r| ≥ 1 DIV

The way I remember the rules for the <span style = "color:orange; font-weight:bold">geomet</span>ric test is, personally, I like <span style = "color:orange; font-weight:bold">geomet</span>ry <span style = "color:purple; font-weight:bold">less</span> than <span style = "color:green; font-weight:bold">c</span>alc so I think |r| <span style = "color:purple; font-weight:bold"> < </span> 1 <span style = "color:green; font-weight:bold">C</span>ON and then the opposite is true: |r| ≥ 1 DIV.

</Rulebox>

In a geometric series, every term contains a common ratio r.

So Σa<sub>n</sub> = `{2 + 4 + 8   + ...}`

is really, Σa<sub>n</sub> = `{a + ar + ar^2 + ...}`

Most of the time you won't be given the series in just a list with dots `{...}` instead it will be given to you in sigma notation or closed form like so,

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img22.src} alt="" />
</div>

Let's practice.

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img46.src} alt="" />
</div>

Here, a = 2 r = 2

a is the first term of the series (when n = 1, 4/2 = 2)  
r is the second term divided by the first (when n = 2, 16/4 = 4 so 4(2nd term)/2(1st term) = 2)

Just by knowing what r is we can find out if the series converges.

Here, because |2| ≥ 1, the series diverges.

### How to find the sum of a geometric series?

Now, if your series happens to converge, you can find what it converges to by using this formula:

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img17.src} alt="" />
</div>

<Note>

There is another formula to find the sum of a geometric series.

<ImageMd img={img51} />

It's the exact same as the a/1-r formula.

</Note>

Let's practice,

# Tests

Again, besides telescoping and geometric series, for all other series we will deal with, we will only be able to find if they converge or not, not what they converge to. We will also have to use tests to prove convergence kind of like we did with geometric series- we used the geometric test.

Telescoping series are really the only ones we do manually. For geometric series, we use the geometric test (similar to the p-test below) but it is still considered a special series because we can find the sum using a formula.

# 10.2 P-series (Harmonic Series/P-Test)
These are like the easiest series ever.

<Rulebox>

**Rules for the P-Test:**

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;align-items:center; gap: 10px;">
  These are series of the form
  <div style="object-fit:contain;">
    
    <img loading="lazy" src={img28.src} alt="" />
  </div>
</div>

If p > 1 CON  
If p ≤ 1 DIV

Use the movie rating <span style ="color:purple; font-weight:bold">P</span><span style ="color:green; font-weight:bold">G</span>-<span style ="color:orange; font-weight:bold">1</span>3 to remember the rules.

<div>
<span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold"> p </span> 
<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> > </span>
<span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold"> 1 </span> <span> CON </span>
</div>

(always start with CON like the geometric test) and then the opposite is true: p ≤ 1 DIV.

I explain it in the video below aswell.

  Divergence Test Solutions

<Alert>

The divergence test does NOT work the opposite way.

We know that if the limit is not 0 then the series diverges.

But it does not say that if the limit IS 0 then the series converges. That is not true.

If it's 0 then we don't know anything about the series. We have to try other tests.

Also, if you know a series diverges, you DON'T automatically know that the limit of the sequence is not 0. It only works in one direction.

If the limit of the sequence is not 0 then the series is divergent. It does not say that if the series is divergent then the limit of the sequence is not 0.

</Alert>


Okay, so now when the series is not a special series like geometric, telescoping, or harmonic _and_ the divergence test does not tell you if it diverges, then we have the integral test.

# Positive Series

The following tests only work for series with positive terms only.

<Note>

Note for the future: We can make negative series positive, so you _will_ be able to use these tests on those series. Yay!

</Note>

# 10.3 Integral Test

<Rulebox>
Only works with series with positive terms or eventually all positive terms.

Conditions:

(1) Positive  
(2) Continuous  
(3) Decreasing

Find,

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  <img loading="lazy" src={img18.src} alt="" />
</div>

**Rules:**  
If L = constant CON so given series will CON aswell.  
If L = ∞ DIV so given series will DIV aswell.

Only works with series with positive terms or eventually all positive terms.

**Rules:**

Given:

</div>

where p is pronounced "row" or "ro" (cuz some mathematician said so 5 billion years ago).

If p = nonzero number then Σb<sub>n</sub> and Σa<sub>n</sub> will either both converge or both diverge depending on what b<sub>n</sub> does.

If p = 0 and Σb<sub>n</sub> converges then Σa<sub>n</sub> will also converge.

If p = ∞ and Σb<sub>n</sub> diverges then Σa<sub>n</sub> will also diverge.

**Note:** At 5:54 I skipped a step. I wrote "√n / n" and then plugged in ∞ to the bottom n but it's supposed to be simplified to 1/√n and *then* you can plug in 1/∞ and *then* it goes to 0.

# Negative Series

# 10.5 Testing for Absolute Convergence & Using the Absolute Convergence Theorem (ACT)

What happens when we have series that includes negative terms?

What tests do we use now to prove convergence if DCT, LCT, Integral and the other tests only work on series that are positive??

Well, because mathematicians are lazy they just said "hey! we don't have to work with series with negative terms- we can just put absolute value signs around them and boom! now they're positive series!"

So just like -1 becomes +1 when you put absolute value signs around it, so does a series become positive when you put absolute signs around it.

<ImageMd img={img39}> </ImageMd>

Great! Now we went from a negative series to a positive one.

But waitttt, doesn't adding absolute value signs around the given series make it a _different_ series?

Yes! That's why we call it the **_corresponding_ positive series**.

The corresponding positive series is not the same as the series you are given but it is related.

By having the corresponding positive series however, we can now use any of the tests that we learned earlier that only work for positive series, like DCT, LCT and Integral to test for convergennce.

"""  
Okay great Sarai. We can use the tests we learned on this corsp. positive series now but...

My professor didn't ask me if the positive corresponding series converges or not, they asked me if the series they gave me converges or not.

So how does testing this <span style = "color:blue"> <b>corresponding positive series </b></span> tell me anything useful about the series I was <span style = "color:red"><b>given</b></span>???

"""

Well, this is the fun part.

We have two tools in our toolbox we can use but we have to use them together.

<Rulebox>

**1. Definition: If <span style = "color:blue"> corresponding positive series </span> converges => <span style = "color:red"> given series </span> converges absolutely.**

**2. Absolute Convergence Theorem (ACT): If <span style = "color:red">given series </span> converges absolutely => <span style = "color:red"> given series </span> also converges**

In other words if we find that the <span style = "color:blue"> <b>corresponding positive series </b></span> converges, we can use those 2 tools to say that the <span style = "color:red"> <b>given series</b> </span> also converges.

</Rulebox>

So, we can get info about the <span style = "color:red"><b> given series</b> </span> by testing it's <span style = "color:blue"> <b>corresponding positive series</b></span>!

<Note>

# Intuition on the Absolute Convergence Theorem

The idea is that when you add absolute value to something, the worst you can do is make that something bigger.

So the <span style = "color:blue"> corresponding positive series </span>- which recall, is just the given negative series with absolute value signs around it- is bigger than the <span style = "color:red"> given negative series. </span>

If that's true, think about it like this: little kids always listen to the big kids.

Let's say both of you kids are on a run.

If big kid says "let's start limiting ourselves to this side of the street, i'm tired." then small kid will listen.

Similarly, if the <span style = "color:blue"> bigger series </span> says "Let's start converging to this number" then the <span style = "color:red"> smaller series </span> will listen and follow the same behavior and converge as well- maybe not the exact same place because remember they're not the exact same series but it _will_ converge.

What's really happening is that when the corresponding positive series converges, the given smaller negative series will have to converge aswell because it will always be smaller than the bigger series and hence will never be able to surpass the bigger series to have a chance at diverging and so we know it will have to be forced to converge aka listen to the big kid.

So if the bigger one stops, so must the smaller one stop.

Which allows us to say that the given series converges absolutely since it's corresponding positive series converges.

Okay! That is how the absolute convergence theorem works.

# Absolute Convergence Tests (Ratio and Root)

**So far:** if we see a negative series, we make it positive, test the corsp. positive series, use our 2 tools to prove the given series converges.

**Now:** if we see a negative series that includes factorials, powers of n or roots, we can use ratio or root test. Only difference is now, we don't have to find the corsp. positive series because the tests do that for us since they come with absolute value signs around the given series so they save us that step.

<Note>

I never liked how Rutgers introduced the ratio and root test as absolute convergence tests.

It doesn't really make sense, because techincally any test is an absolute convergence test if we use that test on a series _with_ absolute values.

For example DCT by itself is not an absolute convergence test, but when we have a negative series and we find it's corresponding positive series(CPS) and use DCT _on_ that CPS, then techincally it's an absolute convergence test in that case because we're testing on a series with absolute values- that's what the CPS is- the negative series with absolute value signs around it.

Personally, I treat ratio and root as any other test. I just think of it like they are saving me a step in finding the CPS because the tests come with absolute value signs around it- automatically making the given series it's CPS, but other than that, everything else is the same- we are still testing for absolute convergence.

</Note>

# Ratio Test

When to use: factorials (n!) and exponentials (2<sup>n</sup>)

With factorial ratio problems, they're easy, it's just some simplification and sometimes some algrebra.

With exponential ratio problems, you will often have to use ln() to cancel stuff out.

## Factorials

You use ratio test mostly on problems that contain factorials so you need to be able to simplify expressions containing factorials.

So, here is a nice little video I made for those of you who absolutely do not understand factorials :)

# 10.6 Alternating Series Test

**What we know:**

Recall: when dealing with negative series, you test the corresponding positive series for absolute convergence.

If the corresponding positive series converges then the given series converges absolutely and by the ACT the given series converges itself and then you're done.

However, if the corresponding positive series diverges then the given series also diverges and then you're done...**BUT there is an exception**.

**What's new:**

If the corresponding positive series diverges _but_ the **given series is alternating**, the given series _may_ still converge.

When to tell the given series is alternating? When you see (-1) anywhere in your series.

If we determine that the given series is alternating and determine that the corresponding positive series diverges, then we can use the alternating series test (AST) to test if the given series converges itself or not.

If the given series does converge then we say the series converges conditionally because the given series did not meet the _condition_ of converging with absolute values but it did converge without them.

Do the following series converge absolutely, converge conditionally or diverge?

<Problem  n="1" img={img35} alt="Problem 1"/>

<Solution>

First, we note that the series is alternating because of the (-1)<sup>n</sup>.

Then, we check for absolute convergence.

The series with absolute value is 1/n which we know by the p-test where p = 1 < = 1 that the series diverges.

Because it might be an alternating series, even though the series with absolute value does not converge, the series _without_ absolute value may or may not converge. We have to check.

How do we check?

By checking the conditions for an alternating series that converges, which are...

<Rulebox>
1.a<sub>n</sub> ≥ 0 Positive  
2.a<sub>n</sub> ≤ a<sub>n</sub> Decreasing   
3.lim as n → ∞ of a<sub>n</sub> = 0  
If all these conditions are met (which they are, check the video for work), we can say that the given series converges conditionally by the alternating series test (AST) (because it literally did not meet the _condition_ of converging absolutely but it did meet the condition of converging (converging w/o absolute value symbols).)
</Rulebox>

</Solution>

<Problem  n="2">
<Latex formula=" \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n n}{n+1} " />
</Problem>

<Solution>
Diverges.
</Solution>

Note: add another version of alternating series cos where you can write it as (-1)<sup>n</sup>.

## Alternating Series Summation Theorem

The main question they ask you is to find the smallest possible integer N that satisfies the inequality.

**1.** Find the smallest integer N such that

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img40.src} alt="" />
</div>

approximates the sum

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  
  <img loading="lazy" src={img41.src} alt="" />
</div>

with an error no greater than 1/100.
