Okay, so this is a draft that hopefully one day I update but to be honest, I did not 'learn' Taylor Series because I ran out of time. I just went to the practice review questions before the second midterm- learned the pattern of how to solve the problems and then got it right on the test- well almost right, I forgot to write the number 2 so I got 2 points off but let's pretend that didn't happen.
