Okay, integration by parts is amazing.

It's just that a lot of people struggle because things can get too messy on their papers and then they forget what's what and it get's all confusing but i'll show you how I set up my paper on exams to keep organized.

<Problem n = "1">
<Latex formula = "\int x e^{x} \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "xe^{x} - e^{x} + C"/>
</Solution>


<Problem n = "2">
<Latex formula = "\int x \cos(2x) \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\frac{1}{2} x \sin(2x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(2x) + C"/>
</Solution>

<Problem n = "3">
<Latex formula = "\int x^2 e^{(3x-5)} \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\frac{1}{3} e^{(3x-5)} \left[ x^2 - \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{2}{9} \right]"/>
</Solution>

<Problem n = "4">
<Latex formula = "\int \tan^{-1}(x) \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\tan^{-1}(x) x - \frac{1}{2} \ln|1+x^2| + C"/>
</Solution>


<Problem n = "5">
<Latex formula = "\int \ln(x) \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "x \ln(x) - x + C"/>
</Solution>


<Problem n = "6">
<Latex formula = "\int \ln(x) \sqrt{x} \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\frac{2}{3} \ln(x)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{4}{9} x^{\frac{3}{2}} + C"/>
</Solution>

<Problem n = "7">
<Latex formula = "\int \sin(\sqrt{x}) \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "-2\sqrt{x} \cos(\sqrt{x}) + 2\sin(\sqrt{x}) + C"/>
</Solution>


<Problem n = "8">
<Latex formula = "\int e^{4x} \cos(x) \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\frac{1}{17} e^{4x} \sin(x) + \frac{4}{17} e^{4x} \cos(x) + C"/>
</Solution>


<Problem n = "9">
<Latex formula = "\int_{1}^{e} \frac{\ln^2(x)}{x^4} \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\frac{2e^{3} - 17}{27e^{3}}"/>
</Solution>

<Problem n = "10">
<Latex formula = "\int \cos(3x) \cos(7x) \, dx"/>
</Problem>
<Solution>
<Latex formula = "\frac{7 \cos(3x) \sin(7x)}{40} - \frac{3 \sin(3x) \cos(7x)}{40} + C"/>
</Solution>
