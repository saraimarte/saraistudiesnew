A complex number is a number **z** of the form 

**z = a + ib**

where **a** and **b** are the real parts of the number and **i** is the imaginary part of the number that has the following property: **i<sup>2</sup> = -1.**

# Operations on Complex Numbers (+, -, x)

We can add, subtract and multiply complex numbers. 

The only difference is that we have an extra superpower: i<sup>2</sup> = -1.

## What About Division (÷) ?

Given a division problem ( a fraction ) just multiply by the conjugate and that is your answer.

# Forms of Complex Numbers 

We can write complex numbers in 3 different forms. 

# Solve for Roots 

z<sup>3</sup> = 8i. 

<Problem n = "1"> <div>z<sup>3</sup> = -125i. </div></Problem>

<Problem n = "2"> <div>z<sup>6</sup> = -64. </div></Problem>

<Problem n = "3"> <div>z<sup>4</sup> = 81. </div></Problem>

<Problem n = "4"> <div>z<sup>2</sup> = -1 + i√3. </div></Problem>

<Problem n = "5"> <div>z<sup>3</sup> = 216. </div></Problem>

<Problem n = "6"> <div>z<sup>2</sup> = i. </div></Problem>
