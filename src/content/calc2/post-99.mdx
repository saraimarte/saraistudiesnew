<RuleBox>
A complex number is a number **z** of the form 

**z = a + ib**

where **a** and **b** are the real parts of the number and **i** is the imaginary part of the number that has the following property: **i<sup>2</sup> = -1.**

# Operations on Complex Numbers (+, -, x)

We can add, subtract and multiply complex numbers. 

The only difference is that we have an extra superpower: i<sup>2</sup> = -1.

## What About Division (รท) ?

Given a division problem ( a fraction ) just multiply by the conjugate and that is your answer.

# Forms of Complex Numbers 

We can write complex numbers in 3 different forms. 

# Solve for Roots 

Just like we solved the roots for polynomials like these, 

x<sup>2</sup> - 9 = 0,

we can solve for roots for these, 

z<sup>3</sup> = 8i.
