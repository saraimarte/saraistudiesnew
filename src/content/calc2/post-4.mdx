Update/Disclaimer 9/25/24 : I solve these problems differently now than in the video solutions so I will be updating the videos soon. They're all correct but the way I explain how to decide the method in the videos is not explained well. See the first FAQ under here to see how to actually find the method to use.

# FAQ

<FAQ question = "How do I know which method to use?">

A common misconception is that there is only one method that can be used in a problem. 

That's wrong. 

Both washer and shell may work for the same problem. One may be harder than another but that's for you to find out.

However, to get a good sense of which method to *try* first, look at your given equation. 

What terms are they in?

For example, y = 2**x** is in **terms of x** because the terms literally contain **x**.

x = **y**/2 is the same equation but in **terms of y** because now the terms contain **y**.

Most of the time, it's easier to keep the equations in the terms they are already in. In this case, I would rather integrate y = 2x than x = y/2. 

The terms your integral will be in depends on 2 things: (1) Axis of Rotation (AOR) which is always given to you and (2) The method that you're using.

If the AOR is y-axis which is x = 0 then you want to use a method that won't change the terms, that is shell.

Because when you use the shell method then you take a look at the AOR. Think **s**ame for **s**hell. You take the same letter and make that your terms. 

Hence, 

AOR: **x** = 0  
Method: **S**hell  
Everything will be in terms of:  **x**  

But that's just a starting point, make sure to graph and see if shell will give you a split integral. 

Maybe the split integral is harder for some reason then you may want to do washer method even though with washer you would have to change the terms of the equation yet that may be easier than doing a split integral.

where r(x) = f(x) or r(y) = f(y). r is just the function they give you.



</FAQ>

<FAQ question = "How do I know if it's a dx or dy integral?">

It depends on what terms you have to work with. To find out the terms, you have to take into account the axis of rotation and the method you're using. That tells you if you're doing your problem in terms of x or y.

Once you find out what terms your problem should be in, remember that tells you what your function/equation, bounds/interval, and integral should be in terms of.
