# FAQ

<FAQ question = "How do I know which method to use?">

That's the wrong question. 

A common misconception is that there is only one method that can be used in a problem. 

That's wrong. 

Both washer and shell may work for the same problem. One may be harder than another but that's for you to find out.

However, to get a good sense of which method to *try* first, look at your given equations/functions/curves. 

What terms are they in?

For example, y = 2**x** is in **terms of x** because the terms literally contain **x**.

x = **y**/2 is the same equation but in **terms of y** because now the terms contain **y**.

Most of the time, it's easier to keep the equations in the terms they are already in. In this case, I would rather integrate y = 2x than x = y/2. 

The terms your integral will be in depends on 2 things: (1) Axis of Rotation (AOR) which is always given to you and (2) The method that you're using.

If the AOR is y-axis which is x = 0 then you want to use a method that won't change the terms, that is shell.

Because when you use the shell method then you take a look at the AOR. Think **s**ame for **s**hell. You take the same letter and make that your terms. 

Hence, 

AOR: **x** = 0  
Method: **S**hell  
Everything will be in terms of:  **x**  

But that's just a starting point, make sure to graph and see if shell will give you a split integral. 

Maybe the split integral is harder for some reason then you may want to do washer method even though with washer you would have to change the terms of the equation yet that may be easier than doing a split integral.

</FAQ>

<FAQ question = "How do I know if it's a dx or dy integral?">

That's also the wrong question. 

It's never a *dx* or *dy* integral. 

It's whatever *you* want it to be. 

You decide what your terms are before starting the problem.

Based on what you want your terms to be in and what the axis of rotation is, you then determine what method is going to let you work in the terms you want to be in. 

It's better explained visually. See the first Disk Example video.
