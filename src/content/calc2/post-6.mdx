This is the same as arclength where it's just a formula and you have to plug in stuff.


<ImageMd>
<Latex formula = "S = 2\pi \int_{a}^{b} R(x) \sqrt{1 + \left( f'(x) \right)^2} \, dx"/>
Formula for surface area
</ImageMd>

The only difference is that R(x) changes depending on axis of rotation and terms of functions but luckily I figured out that part for you.

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "T = Terms of"/>

Let's see this in action.

Find the areas of the surfaces generated when the given curves are revolved around the given axis.

**1.** y = 3x + 4 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 6 around the x-axis.

<Solution>

<Latex formula = '156\pi \sqrt{10}'/>

</Solution>

**2.** y = 8√x for 9 ≤ x ≤ 20 around the x-axis.

<Solution>

<Latex formula = '\frac{2912\pi}{2}'/>

</Solution>

**3.** y = x<sup>2</sup>/4 for 2 ≤ x ≤ 4 around the y-axis.

<Solution>

<Latex formula = '\frac{8\pi}{3} \left( 5\sqrt{5} - 2\sqrt{2} \right)'/>

</Solution>

**4.** x = √(16y-y<sup>2</sup>) for 0 ≤ y ≤ 8 around the y-axis.

<Solution>

<Latex formula = '128\pi'/>

</Solution>
