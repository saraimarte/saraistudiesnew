So far, we have only been given functions that are defined within the bounds but now we'll be dealing with the opposite.

There are 2 types of improper integrals.

Type 1 : One of the bounds contain an infinity symbol

Type 2 : All bounds are anything but infinity symbols- like numbers. But at least one of them OR a number in between the bounds have to make the function being integrated undefined.

# Type 1 

<RuleBox>

<p>When you see an infinity as a bound- it is a type 1 improper integral.</p>

</RuleBox>


# Type 2


<RuleBox>

<p>When you DON'T see an infinity as a bound- it is a type 2 improper integral.</p>

<p>With these integrals you have to be particular about from which side either from the left or right you are taking the limit from. You use the bounds to determine which side.</p>
