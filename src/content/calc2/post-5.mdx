When you find arclength you're just finding the length of a curve.

The types of problems you will see will give you a function and you basically have to plug it's derivative into this formula.

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "Formula for arclength"/>

So, the hard part is clearly not finding the arc length - it's finding the derivative and doing the algebra after plugging it into the formula.

Also, you might ask why is arc length denoted as _s_? Shouldn't that be for surface area?

I agree with you but that's how these math people decided to denote arc length. Okay, let's move on.

**1**. Let K be the part of the curve y = x<sup>3/2</sup> between x = 0 and x = 4. Calculate the arclength of K.
