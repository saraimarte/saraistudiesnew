When you find arclength you're just finding the length of a curve.

The types of problems you will see will give you a function and you basically have to plug it's derivative into this formula.

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "Formula for arclength"/>

So, the hard part is clearly not finding the arc length - it's finding the derivative and doing the algebra after plugging it into the formula.

Also, arc length can be denoted by S or L. It doesn't really matter as long as the formula is correct.

# Special Trick (Saves you some algebra!)

Recall the formula for arc length: 

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "Formula for arclength"/>

Do you see the stuff inside the square root? This stuff:

<Latex formula="1 + f'(x)^2" />

Yeah, cool thing is- we can sometimes rewrite it as a perfect square and then be able to cancel the root out leaving us with a root free integrand!

For some arc length problems where 

# Practice

**1**. Let K be the part of the curve y = x<sup>3/2</sup> between x = 0 and x = 4. Calculate the arclength of K.
