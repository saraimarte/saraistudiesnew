So far, we have only been given functions that are defined within the bounds but now we'll be dealing with the opposite.

There are 2 types of improper integrals.

Type 1 : One of the bounds contain an infinity symbol

Type 2 : All bounds are anything but infinity symbols- like numbers. But at least one of them OR a number in between the bounds have to make the function being integrated undefined.
