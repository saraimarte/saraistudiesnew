What we know: Infinite series of numbers: Σ `{1, 2, 3,...}`.

What's new: Infinite series of powers of x: Σ `{1x, 2x^2, 3x^4,...}`.

that's why it's called a...power series :)

## What do we care about?

We care about finding four things:  
(1) Interval of Convergence (IOC)  
(2) Convergence of Bounds  
(3) Radius of Convergence (ROC)  
(4) Center (a)

One of the biggest differences between an infinite series and a power series is that an infinite series, if it converges, converges to a finite number. A power series converges over an interval. So instead of finding at what specific point it converges, we find the interval in which is converges.

<div style={{ objectFit: "cover", width: "100%", height: "200px" }}>
  <img src={img1.src} alt="" style={{ width: "auto", height: "100%" }} />
</div>

You will know when a series is a power series because that is the only time they ask for IOC or ROC.

Treat these as any other series you have been working except the only tests you will be using are root and ratio and the answer will involve an x at the end. Then there's one more extra step after that.

## Example

Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence for

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
  <img src={img2.src} alt="" /> </div>

If it is not a geometric series then you will first have to do ratio or root test.

Test: Root. Why? Because I see a power of n.
