The idea is that when you have a region bounded by two graphs, if you revolve that region around a line- you get what's called a solid of revolution because it's a literal solid generated by revolving a region about any line.

For the next few weeks you will be finding the volume of those solids.

How do we find the volume??

Well, let's pretend for a moment that the solikd of revolution that was created was a loaf of bread.

If you slice a loaf of bread, that slice is what we call a cross-section.

That slice has area and a bit of thickness.

If we keep slicing, and keep adding up the areas of those slices times their thickness from one point to another, we will get the volume of the entire loaf of bread.

Essentially, for any cross-section, we can find it's area and thickness and add it up and get our volume.

In this lesson, we will work with all type of cross sections from triangles to squares but in the next two lessons we will be focusing on a specific type of cross-section- disks and then shells!

Let's start!

Find the volume of a solid whose base is the region bounded by the graphs y = √x and y = x/2, whose cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis are **isosceles triangles** of height 6.

Find the volume of a solid whose base is the region bounded by the graphs y = √x and y = x/2, whose cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis are **semicircles** with diameters running across the base of the solid.
