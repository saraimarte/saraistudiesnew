We are used to expressing a point with (x , y).

Another way to express the same point is with (r , θ)

With r being how far away the point is from the origin (radius) and θ being the angle from the x-axis to r.

## Cartesian to Polar Coordinates

There can be many possible polar coordinates for one cartesian coordinate.

Formulas:

<div style="object-fit:contain;">
     <img src={img2.src} alt="" /> </div>

tan(θ) = y/x

**1.** (1 , 1)

<Solution>

</Solution>
**2.** (-3 , 0)

<Solution>

</Solution>
**3.** (√3 , -1)

<Solution>

</Solution>
**4.** (-3 , 4)

<Solution>

</Solution>
## Polar to Cartesian Coordinates

Formulas:  
x = r cosθ  
y = r sinθ

**1.** (√2 , 𝜋/4)

<Solution>

</Solution>
**2.** (2 , -𝜋/4)

<Solution>

</Solution>
**3.** (4√2 , -𝜋/4)

<Solution>

## Polar to Cartesian Curves

Convert the following polar equations to cartesian equations.

**1.** r = 4cos(θ)

<Solution>

</Solution>
**2.** r = 6sinθ - 2cos(θ)
