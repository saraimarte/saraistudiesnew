# Basics 

**Information System:** where we store and manage information.

**Does an info system need software to exist? No.**

Think about it, what info system does the police department use?

A file cabinet. That is where they store their information (their case files) and no software is needed for that.

They can manage/filter those case files by year, gender, crime, age, etc.

## Data is the most valuable resource. 

Nowadays,  every decision we make in a business is driven by data, making data more valuable than oil.

Imagine just deciding to sell icecream in the winter without looking at any data.

If you look at the data, you'll see some new information: that icecream sales in the winter are lower than in the summer.

Hence, when we look at the information we got from the data, we make better decisions. 

Hence, the more data we have -> the more info we have -> the better decisions we make. 

So the goal is to get as much data as possible.

But just like everything else we want more of- we have to store it somewhere.

And that place better be able to store a *lot* of data. 

# Where do we store data?

First, we stored data in floppy disks, then we moved on to USBs, then hardrives, and now SSDs.

<div style = "display:flex;">
<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "Floppy Disk 1.4MB"/>
<ImageMd img = {img2} alt = "USB 2TB"/>
<ImageMd img = {img3} alt = "Hard Drive 32TB"/>
<ImageMd img = {img4} alt = "SSD 100TB"/>
</div>

Over the years, since we kept wanting more data, we needed more space to store the data so we needed new capable technology that could store a *bunch* of data.

We also have our phones and computers that store data.

Now, imagine you own a company. Will you store all of your customer's data in a hard drive at home? In your phone? In your computer? In your laptop? 
 
Well, what do you do when you run out of storage on your phone? You upgrade your iCloud so they give you more storage space on the cloud. 

What do you do when you run out of google photos storage? You pay for more storage.

What do you do when you run out of gmail storage? You pay for more storage.

Where is this storage?

The cloud. 

So, when your're paying for more storage, you're paying for more space in the cloud and to cover some of the costs of the energy inccured by keeping it up and running. 

But where is the cloud?

The cloud is an actual place- it is literally a room full of servers. 

**Servers:** collection of computers or storage devices that store your data.

There are companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) that offer cloud services (aka servers) to store your data.

# How does data travel?

There are literal cables all across the ocean floor that allow data to travel from one place to another. 

## Outliers

Are outliers useful? Depends on the situation.

For example, if you have an annual amount for purchases of $700 then you would would be interested in that outlier. The outlier cna help you detect fraud.

## Explanatory vs Exploratory data.

Explanatory: Smoking causes cancer. You look at data to prove a point. 
Exploratory: Does smoking cause cancer? You look at data for coorelation.

## Database vs Tables

Databases: can store more data, can scale well, holds data integrity (define data types.)

Tables: can store less data, does not scale well, does not hold data integrity (you can put a name in for a value that's supposed to be an age.)
