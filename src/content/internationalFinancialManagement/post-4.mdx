Foreign Exchange is the largest market globally. 

Since there is no central place the ... acts like dealer and brokers. 

Dealers => like banks or car dealership putting capital at risk to provide prodcut you want in the end 

Broker =>  like a real estate broker. they want to sell house, they find buyers, and once the real estate transaction closes they get paid

# Whiteboard 

Think from equity perspective. 

## Stock:

Before: $1/1 Share  

Exchange $ for 1 share 

After: Sell $; Buy Shares 

I no longer have a dollar. 

## FX: 

### american style/ direct 

Exchange $ for 1 Foreign Currency 

$1/1FK 

"how many dollars to buy euro, pound, auD$, NZD$"   

### European/Indirect 
yen, pesos, thailand, brazil, etc. 
How much FK for 1 U.S. dollar?
1FK/$1 


# Cross Exchange Rates 

S = "spot"


# The Bid Ask Spread 

Bank is buying low and selling high but in FX we are exchanging currencies.
