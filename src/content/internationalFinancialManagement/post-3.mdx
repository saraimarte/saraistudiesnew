# Balance of Payments 


From a countries perspective. It's similar to how we have a checking account. 
We have cash flows in and out on any given month. 
At the end of the month, we have a starting balance, debits and credits, and ending balance. 

Those debits and credits have to balance. 

It's the same thing for countries- it can tell you if a country 


P.O.V. From credit and debit standpoint.

Credit => sell something from the U.S. overseas and we receive capital for that. so that gets converted to U.S. dollars.  

Debit => we pay for product made outside and bring it to the U.S. This requires our dollars coming out so we're increasing our supply of dollars. Because by paying for that product we are putting out dollars. 

Good and services is a country's trade balance.  


# The Current Account 

**1. Goods Trade:** are physical tangible products found outside of the country and imported into the U.S (we tend to import more)

**2. Services:** consulting, legal advice, financial services, engineering  (we tend to export more)

**3. Primary Income:**

**4. Secondary Income** usually just foreign aid (we usually give more aid than we receive.) (usually small but negative number)


 # Global Account 

 # Financial Account 

 Difference between... 

 Purchasing or building a company in another country 

 We have 3 categories. 

 **1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**

 **2. Portfolio Investment:**

 **3. Other Investment:**
