# Ethical Decision Making Process 

**1.** Identify the facts 

**2.** Identify if there are ethical issues 

**3.** Identify the stakeholders and consider the situation from their POV.

**4.** Identify the alternatives. This is called using **Moral Imagination** 

**5.** Make a decision, a plan and carry it out 

**6.** Monitor and learn from your outcomes. 

Maybe you didn't recognize all stakeholders or identify other alternatives, etc. 

# When Ethical Decision Making Fails 

**1.** Maybe we are ignorant 

**2.** We consider limited alternatives 

**3.** We select the alternative that satisfies the minimum requiremnts for the decision. 


Heuristic is something that helps us make quick easy decisions. 

**4.** Sometimes it's easier to do the wrong thing. 

**5.** We didn't have the courage to stand up to people in the group because of peer pressure. 


Everybody goes through the same process of ethical decision making but we all do it differently especially as we age.

**1. Pre-Conventional Level:** they are afraid what is going to happen to them (reputation)

A lot of people are in the conventional level
