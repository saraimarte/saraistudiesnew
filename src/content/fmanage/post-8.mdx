# How to compute returns on investments?

# How to compute risk of an investment?

We use standard deviation to measure the risk of an investment.

# Efficient Markets 

## Features of financial markets 

Efficient- or good- markets have the following features (**HRCS**):

**1. H**igh stakes- lots of money invested and at risk   

**2. R**ational Investors - investors that make rational, calm, decisions by evaluating pros and cons.   

**3. C**ompetition - everyone trying to win by finding the best investment   

**4. "S**mart money"- this term we use to refer to people who are large investors (banks, hedge funds, etc.)  

I like to think of it as **HR...CS** as in the HR major and then CS major. You know, business and science major, like what i'm doing.

## Two concepts for financial markets

**1."The price is right"**  - stocks are fairly priced and are sold for their "true" values and the stock price will only change only when new information comes in.    

**2. "There is no free lunch"** - it is not possible to beat the market and predict future returns. Returns will always be proportional to the risk you take. The more risk, the more return.
