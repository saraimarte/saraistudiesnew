In the last lesson, we learned how to budget our capital, such as investing in projects.

In this lesson, we will focus on where the capital comes from.

Remember 'capital' is just a fancy way of saying 'money.'

**Questions to Consider:**

What is the structure of our capital?

Does your capital come from borrowing?

Does it come from raising money?

Does it come from a combination, like 50% borrowing and 50% raising money?

**Key Fact:**

There is a cost to capital. Where you get it from impacts that cost.

If you borrow all your capital, there are costs associated with borrowing.  

If you raise all your capital from shareholders, there are costs to that too.  

# How much does your capital cost?

## If you borrowed all your capital...

Then your cost are your interest payments which is just a percentage out of the amount of money you borrowed. That percentage is the yield to maturity (YTM<sub>D</sub>.) 

So the cost of borrowing money is just 

<Latex formula="\text{YTM}_D \times \text{Amount borrowed}" />

But here's a fun fact! 

Interest payments are tax-deductible. 

Meaning to get the *true* cost of borrowing money you need to account for the taxes (τ<sub>c</sub>) you're not paying. 

So, we take the current cost of borrowing and simply subtract our taxes τ<sub>c</sub>.

<RuleBox>
<Latex formula="(1 - \tau_c) \times \text{ytm}_D \times \text{Amount borrowed}" />
</RuleBox>

Suppose a firm issues a corporate bond with a yield to maturity of 7.5%. What is the cost of capital for debt for the firm, if the tax rate is 30%?

<Solution>

5.25% 

</Solution>

## If you raised all your capital...

<RuleBox>
<Latex formula="R_E = r_F + \beta_E \left(E[R_M] - r_F\right)" />
**r<sub>F</sub>** is the risk-free rate.  

**β<sub>E</sub>** is the beta for stock or firm E.

**R<sub>M</sub>** is the expected return on the market.

</RuleBox>

Suppose XYZ Corp has an equity beta of 1.25. The current risk-free rate is 4.5%, and the expected return on the market is 10.2%. What is the cost of capital for equity for this company?

<Solution>

11.63% 

Interpretation: Investors expect a return of 11.63% annually on the money they invest in your company.  

</Solution>

## If you borrowed and raised capital...

<RuleBox>
<Latex formula="\omega_E \times R_E + \omega_D \times \text{ytm}_D \times (1 - \tau)" />
</RuleBox>

A firm is funded with $300 million in equity and $200 million in debt. The yield to maturity on bonds issued by the firm is 6.5%. The tax rate is 35%. The firm has a beta of 1.25. The risk-free rate is 4%, and the market risk premium is 8%. What is the cost of capital for this firm?

<Solution>

10.09% 

</Solution>

# How much of your capital should come from debt and equity?
