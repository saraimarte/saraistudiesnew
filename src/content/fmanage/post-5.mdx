# What are bonds?

When you buy a bond you're just buying a contract- a piece of paper that says when you will be paid back. 

With bonds, you always get paid back the principle, the amount you bought it for.  

# Relationship between bond prices and interest rates

# How are interest rates determined?

A bond is like a stock. It's an investment if you are the one buying it.

A bond contains 4 items.

**1.** **Par value** or **face value (FV)** (usually $1,000 or $100) - how much do they have to pay you back?  

**2.** The **length of time (T)/time to maturity** (usually 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 years)- when will they pay it back?  

**3.** A **coupon interest rate (C)** - how much interest will they pay?  

**4.** The **price of the bond**- how much you are investing? how much are you letting the other party borrow?  

Every year you get C% of FV and then at the last year you get your FV back. 

# How do we value/price bonds?


A bond is issued by TechCorp that pays you a coupon of 5%. The par or face value of the bond is $1,500, and the bond has 6 years to maturity. If the yield to maturity is 7%, what is the value of the bond?

(A) $1,357.30  
(B) $357.49      
(C) $1652.27

Toyota issues a bond with a face value of $1,000. It pays a coupon rate of 6%. The coupon payments are semi-annual (i.e., every 6 months). The yield to maturity on the bond is 8%. The bond matures in 5 years. The price of this bond is:

(A) $920.146 //if you forget to adjust for semi-annual   
(B) $1085.30 //if you switch coupon rate and ytm   
**(C) $918.89**  

# How do we find the coupon rate of a bond? (Plug and See)  

A bond trades for $4,800 today. It has a face value of $5,200, and the yield to maturity for the bond is 8.45%. The bond matures in 12 years. The coupon rate for this bond is:

(A) 5.2341%  
**(B) 7.9068%**  
(C) 2.2341%  

# Relationships

<RuleBox>
If ytm increases then price of bond decreases.  

If Tesla promises a **10%** coupon rate but the market interest rate is **5%**
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they are issuing this bond at a **discount** or in other words, you're buying this bond at a discount because the market rate is actually higher and your're getting it for less.  

If Tesla promises a **10%** coupon rate but the market interest rate is **10%**
&nbsp; Then they are issuing this bond at **par-value**/face-value.   

If Tesla promises a **10%** coupon rate but the market interest rate is **20%**
&nbsp; Then they are issuing this bond at a **premium**.

# Types of bonds

There are multiple ways to classify bonds. 

## High grade vs low grade. 

A bond is **high grade** if they are more likely to pay you back.

**Low grade** if they are more likely to file for bankruptcy. 

## Who is borrowing 

Borrower can be the **U.S Federal government**-this is what we call a **treasury security**. 

Borrower can be **state or local government or school district** like Rutgers- this is what we call a **Municipal security**.  

## What interest do they pay?

**Zero coupon bonds (ZCBs)** are when coupon rate is 0%.  

They always sell less than face value.  

**Floating Rate Bonds** are where the rate changes over time.     


# Practice 

**1.** Smithson Enterprises issued a 25-year bond with a coupon rate of 6% and a face value of $1,200. The yield-to-maturity on the bond is 5.5%. What is the price of the bond?

**(A) $1,280.48**      
(B) $1,150.45      
(C) $1,050.45       


**2.** Chevrolet issues a bond with a face value of $5,000. It pays a coupon rate of 4%. The coupon payments are quarterly (i.e., every 3 months). The yield to maturity on the bond is 9%. The price of this bond is:

(A) $4,367.18  // not taking into account time period of payments  
(B) $5,650.92       
**(C) $4,349.08**
