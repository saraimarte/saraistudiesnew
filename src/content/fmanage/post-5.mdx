When you buy a bond you're just buying a contract- a piece of paper that says when you will be paid back. 

With bonds, you always get paid back the principle, the amount you bought it for.  


# Relationship between bond prices and interest rates

# How are interest rates determined?

A bond is like a stock. It's an investment if you are the one buying it.

A bond contains 4 items.

**1.** **Par value** or **face value (FV)** (usually $1,000 or $100) - how much do they have to pay you back?  

**2.** The **length of time (T)/time to maturity ** (usually 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 years)- when will they pay it back?  

**3.** A **coupon interest rate (C)** - how much interest will they pay?  

**4.** The **price of the bond**- how much you are investing? how much are you letting the other party borrow?  

Every year you get C% of FV and then at the last year you get your FV back.
