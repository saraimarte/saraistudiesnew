Companies have money, which we call capital.

Capital budgeting is deciding how to spend that money.

How do companies spend that money? By investing in projects or other types of investments.

The main question we try to answer in this topic is: "As a company, should we invest in this project or not?"

To decide, we use three techniques to determine if an investment is worth it. 

How is it worth it? If your gain more capital than you spent. 

Here are the techniques:

**1.** The NPV rule   
**2.** The IRR rule  
**3.** The Payback Period  

# NPV Rule 

Some firms like to decide if they should invest in a project only if they will actually make more than what they invested.    

For example, Netflix may be like, â€œWe will only invest in this project if we will actually make back the money we spent." 

Why would anyone invest in a project where you wouldn't get all your money back? Possibly non-profits. 

This is a better measure than NPV because it accepts or rejects a project based on it's value instead of it's return (IRR) and if you remember in the first chapter, we mentioned that the goal of a firm is to maximize *value*. 

## NPV and Discount Rates 

# IRR Rule  

Some firms like to decide if they should invest in a project only if the rate will give them an NPV of 0. 

The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes NPV = 0.  

If you have excel, there is an easy IRR function but on exams you will be given rates as answer choices so you just plug them into the formula and pick the answer that gives you an NPV closest to 0.

# The Payback Period  

Some firms like to decide if they should invest in a project only if they will get their money back in a predetermined amount of years. 

For example, Netflix may be like "We will only invest in this project if we get the amount we invested back in 2 years or less."

We call these "2 years or less" what we would *want* the payback period to be.  

The payback period is simply the actual number of years it takes for the investment to pay us back what we invested at first. 

Let's see how we figure that out here. 

# Investing with Resource Constraints
