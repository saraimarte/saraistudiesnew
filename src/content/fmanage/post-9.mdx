In **Topic 8**, we learned how to calculate the return and risk of a ***single* investment.**

For example, let’s say you invest in Apple stock—we focused on understanding the potential returns and the risks associated with that *one* investment.

In **Topic 9**, we learn how to do the exact same thing, but with a ***group* of investments**- also known as a portfolio.

For instance, if you invested in both Apple and Netflix stocks, we’ll learn how to calculate the combined return and risk for the *entire* portfolio.

# How to compute the total return for a portfolio?

Use **WRA**! Multiply **W**eights by **R**eturns and then **A**dd them together. 

What do we mean by weights? What do we mean by multiply by returns if returns is what we're trying to find!?

Well, I explain in the video below.

# Conceptual stuff

## Why do investors invest in portfolios

Investors invest in portfolios because it's diverse and they are not putting all their eggs in one basket.

If they invested in only one stock the risk would be high.

If they invest in a group of stocks - a portfolio- that reduces the risk without reducing return. 

Also, firm-specific risk can be eliminated by investing in a group of stocks. 

What if firm-specific risk?

## What are the two kinds of risks?

There are two types of risks: firm-specific and market-specific risks. 

### Firm-specific risk

Firm-specific risk are risks specific to well, firms. For example,

You buy one share of a lumber company and one share of a furniture manufacturer. **What happens if the price of the lumber jumps by 40%?**

What does that mean? Well, the value of the stock goes up for the lumber company because it's making more money but it will likely go down for the furniture manufacturer because costs going up means more production expenses reducing profitability. 

Yet, because you diversified and invested in this group of stocks, it doesn't hurt you that much because it balances out! One goes up and the other goes down. 

If you had only invested in a single stock like the furniture manufacturer, then you would have lost a lot. 

This means **we can eliminate firm-specific risk** by investing in multiple firms so that if anything happens, the effect may be balanced out. 

Which goes to show why we should invest in portfolios- in a *group* of stocks.

### Market-specific risk 

**This risk cannot be eliminated** no matter what you do.

For example, let's say you buy one share of a lumber company and one share of a furniture manufacturer. **What happens if a recession hits?**

See the difference?

A recession is a market-wide risk. It affects the entire market and poses a risk to all firms—in this case, both the lumber and furniture companies.

You can't control recessions, and you can't eliminate market-specific risk.

However, you can ensure that your firm-specific risk is minimized by diversifying your portfolio (aka investing in multiple firms.)

## How do we measure market-wide and firm-specific risk?

By computing Beta. 

<Problem n = "1">
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) returns 60% when the economy is strong and -10% when the economy is weak. A firm’s returns are 70% when the economy is strong and -10% when the economy is weak. What is the beta of the firm?
</Problem>

<Solution>
**Answer: β = 1.14**
</Solution>

## What is the relation between market-wide, firm-specific risk, and returns?
