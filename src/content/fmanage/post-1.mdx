Financial management is all about answering three questions. 

When you start a businessa, these are three questions you ask yourself:

**1.** What assets buy and how much of it to buy?    What's a good investment?

**2.** How will you pay for those assets?   Where do I get money to keep investing?

**3.** How will you pay for your day to day expenses?  How do I make sure I have enough money to pay for our expenses.

By answering these questions we are making the following type of financial decisions:

**1.** Capital Budgeting: Is an investment a good idea or not? figure out if it's a good investment;  something you should put your money in?

**2.** Capital Structure: What's the best way to finance this business idea? To buy those assets?

**3.** Liquidity (bills) Management (Working Capital Management): How will you pay for your day to day expenses?  

Example

Insidental Expenses: gas spent, time spent, etc.  
Opportunity Cost: the cost of storing someone else's car in your garage and they giving you $400.   

Incidental Revenues:   
If you go to a car dealership, the dealer may give you a discount hoping you will come back to them for maintenence (oil change etc.) for the rest of your life since you liked their price so the dealer now makes way more than what they would have selled the car for.
