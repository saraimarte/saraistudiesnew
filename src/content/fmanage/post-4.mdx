In the video above, I showed you how to discount multiple cash flows over 4 years. But what if it's more than 4 years? What if they ask you to find the value of 60 cash flows today? Are you really going to waste time discounting each one?

Luckily, there are shortcuts to make it easier!

These shortcuts work under certain conditions, so let's go over them!

# Shortcuts to Discounting Multiple Yearly Payments

# What if they're not yearly payments? What if they are quarterly, semi-annually, etc.?
