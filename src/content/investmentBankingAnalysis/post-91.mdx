# Questions 

Good Morning, 

I have some questions regarding the final paper: 

1. Do we/can we include sources/citations in our paper? E.g. (See 2025 10k p175) or (Yahoo Finance)

2. Do we expand on the unqualified opinion from the auditor? Or just state that there was an unqualified opinion or not and that's it?

3. For the Adjusted EBITDA Bridge in the ProjectionModel Excel you provided, there are only 3 line items for adjustments, if there are more adjustments included in our statement of cashflows, can we add them to the bridge or do you just want us to include those 3 line items if they exist and that's it?

4. For the companies we have covered in class like Macy's or Home Depot- their P&L's simply have "Net Income" as a line item. My company also has "Net Income" but after that it has "Net Income attributable to the Ford Motor Company" as well. I keep going back and forth as to which one to choose to use as the net income in the adj. EBITDA bridge so I wanted to ask if you could advice me on which one is best to choose and why. 

My thought process: I'm thinking I should choose "Net Income attributable to the Ford Motor Company" as the net income because the idea of EBTIDA is to look at earnings Ford generated itself not other non-controlling entities. I believe that's fine as long as the Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization numbers on the Cash Flow Statement relate to only Ford and not the consolidated entity but I'm not sure if they do or not. 

Accounting Rule: They are consolidated numbers so they include non-controlling interest.
