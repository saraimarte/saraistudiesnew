So far we have been given assumptions. 

TO put together a financial model you are making assumptions (educated guesses) regarding the company:

Revenue 
Gross Margins
Operating Expenses etc.

If they are not good then your model is trash.

After you're working with a model there are two seperate 

Base Case: the scenario you believe is the most likely outcome.

Sensitized Projections: This is the companys downside. You would tie it to the risks which you have identified earlier on in class. 

Identified risks in companys business model (base case)

If those risks are realized how would it impact the company (Sensitized projections)


The downside scenerio
