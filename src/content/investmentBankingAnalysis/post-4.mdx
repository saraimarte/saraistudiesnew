# What is Financial Modelling and Why Do We Do It?
<RuleBox>
**Def.** **Financial Modelling** is the process of building a spreadsheet (usually in Excel) that <Pop t = "predicts">forecasts</Pop> a company's future financial performance based on **assumptions** you make as an analyst.
</RuleBox>

A company's financial performance can be determined by their income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. 

In other words, financial modeling is simply you creating a <Pop t = "prediction">forecast</Pop> of these three financial statements.

This means that when all the modeling is done, what you literally have in front of you is a predicted Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.

**What's the point of coming up with predicted statements / financial modelling?**

When investors want to invest in a company, they want to get an idea about a company's financial health in the future and so
they use these predicted statements to answer questions that will help them decide if the investment is actually a good idea. 

<ul>
<li style = "margin-left:20px">For an Equity Investor (shareholder): "Will this company become more profitable?"</li>
<li  style = "margin-left:20px">For a Credit Investor (lender): "Will this company generate enough cash to pay its debts?"</li>
</ul>

<Note>Understanding what aspects of these predicted statements to use to answer questions shareholders vs lenders have is a skill that we'll focus on in later lectures. Now, we'll focus on actually building the models. We can focus on how to use them to answer questions later. </Note>

But now, it's time to review these statements and all of their line items.  

# Types of Statements/Sheets

## 1 | Income Statement 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** An <Pop t = "statement of operations, earnings statement, or profit and loss statement (P&L)">**income statement**</Pop> is an overview of the revenue and expenses <Pop t = "collected"> incurred </Pop> during a specific time period (e.g. 1/1/2021 to 12/31/2021.) It's useful when analyzing the profitability generated by the firm.  
</RuleBox>

## 2 | Cash Flow Statement 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **cash flow statement** is cash accounting. It answers the question, "what caused changes in the Company's cash balance during the year?"
</RuleBox>

## 3 | Balance Sheet

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **balance sheet** is a snapshot in time of the assets and liabilities of the company. The time period is one day (e.g. 12/31/2021)
</RuleBox>

# Modelling 

Our predictions are based on historical data and assumptions we make for the future. 

You get the historical data from company's public financial reports. 

And the assumptions are something  we're given right now (we focus on making correct assumptions later.)

You're projecting Revenue, Gross Margins, Operating Expenses, etc. 

# Practice

## Financial Statement Analysis 

**1.** The following Sis summarized financial data for Apex Industries for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023 ($ in millions):   

<ImageMd img={i1} alt = ""> </ImageMd>

Your Tasks:  

**a**. Calculation | Calculate the Adjusted EBITDA for both 2024 and 2023.
<Solution>
EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.   

EBITDA = Earnings - anything that's not ITDA

EBITDA =  Net Sales/Revenue - COGS - SG&A  = $1,200 -700 -240 = 260  

Adjusted EBITDA is adding back anything that only happens once like the one-time litigation settlement that was in the SG&A for 2024. 

Adj. EBITDA = EBITDA + 25 = 260 + 25 = 285  

</Solution>
**b**. Analysis | Based on your calculations, describe what primarily caused the change in Adjusted EBITDA between 2023 and 2024. Justify your answer by calculating the necessary percentage margins.

**c**. Qualitative | You are about to have a follow-up meeting with Apex's management team. Based solely on the financial data and adjustments provided, what is one specific, insightful question you would ask management?
