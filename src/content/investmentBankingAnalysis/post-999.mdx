test test 

1. Correct Don't overstate people lost points because of it. 

2. Read slides. 1 of these 6. Not npv, future value or present value. These are the things you bring up if you're presenting a bond to poeple. 

The first 5 are ways to reduce risk. Amoritzation, collateral, covenants, gurentees, tenor maturity.

3. He said as long as it was around the 20's for two years.

Anything between D and A Depreciation and amorrixation excluding... consilard stateemtn of cash flows (two ways to find DnA) and Changes is what you would add back as an adjustement. 

Adjustements are not just in P&L but also in cahs flow statment. 

4. It is not taxes, or interest or net income (why?) its revenue gross margin and operation expressions. 

DnA is not a valid reasoning. It deosnt affect EBIDTA. If you change it EBITDA stays the same. 

EBITDA op income + DnA 

op income change = changes in revenue and changes in gross margin and operation expenses (cost structure)


GPM = gross profit margin 

What did impact adj EBITDA not what could impact adj EBITDA use numbers. 

three areas of focus and if there is large adjustement then mention it.  

MDandA sessions not on midterms. You don't need it to answer this question.  
It's math.  

5. large change in any line item that should be a question. 

"Were there any nonreccurding expenses?" You can throw this question is always. 

"What portion of the company's SG&A is fixed vs variable?"

If everything is varaible thats good if they go on a downturn there is a lot of stuff they can cut off because only thing they have thats fixed that cant go away is salary and rent.  

The financials dont tell you if something is non reccuring or not unless its like obvious like litigation (one time law fees. )  



If key change is revenue increased/decreased or margins expanded ask why. 


In this class just focus on cash flow statement between dna and 


6. 
debt to ebitda increases risk increases 
debt to ebitda decreases risk descreases 

debt to ebtida = leverage 

its the number one factor that impacts ratings. 
and whether a bank will lend money to a company( bank wont lend to companeis with high ebitda)
and internal risk ratings a bank has. 

In quiz he was lintinet as long as you tied it in with something from the financials then okay but on exams hes looking specfic for the debt to ebitda ratio/leverage mention.

interview tip: mention leverage. 



Modelling 

What does flat mean? Dosn't change = stays the same 



Flat as a percent of revenue means find ____ as percent of revenue and have that be the same for all years. 

he could also say increase as a percent of sales. 

submit excel file so he could see your work. 

Put ANYTHING he said even its "complete nonsense" for leave. 

he will maybe add more line items on exam. 

12-13 questions of financial analysis  and modelling 

He gave formula in quiz but will not in exam memorize like AR AP and Inventory

Net profit = net income 

increase in asset is a use of cash so its decrease in cash.
decrease in asset is a gain? of cash so its increase in cash.

its working capital asset. 


For question 9 and 10 

impairment or any non cash expense he gives you you treat it the same way as DnA

If you say [...] treat it like accounts payable. 8:29pm 

Example of sending excel gives 90% instead of 20%. 

10. 
in the cash flow statement when you spend cash its negative if you gain gash its positive!!! so make sure your format is right.  

CAPEX - he could say its...

flat 

percent of last year pp and e 

or grow by some amount 



CFO = cash from operations


11. "How would it impact stock price" = "How would it impact future cash flows?"

[...]
price decreases = revenue decreases = gross margin decrease/contract

lower margins results in less free cash flow - stock decreases.


12. Revenue growth, operating expenses, gross margin and ebtida adjustements.

https://www.troutman.com/insights/minimal-blanket-maximum-comfort-less-is-more-when-drafting-all-assets-ucc-1-descriptions/

1. The Key Message ("Less is More")

    The Problem: The court (the Second Circuit Court of Appeals) advised lenders that when describing a borrower's assets on the main public notice form (UCC-1 financing statement) for a "blanket lien" (covering all of the borrower's assets), simplicity is better.

    First Niagara's Mistake: The bank, First Niagara, unnecessarily added extra details to its "all assets" description. It used the phrase "including but not limited to," followed by a specific list of assets and the address where they were located.

    The Consequence: When the borrower moved to a new address, the old, specific address remained on the UCC-1 filing. This unnecessary detail later gave the bankruptcy trustee (the person managing the company's bankruptcy) a reason to challenge the bank's entire claim.

2. The Legal Challenge

    The Background: The borrower (Sterling) took out loans from First Niagara and granted the bank a security interest over "all of its assets." To make this claim public (perfect the security interest), the bank filed a UCC-1 statement with the detailed, location-specific description.

    The Change: The borrower changed its name and moved its headquarters. First Niagara updated the name and address on the filing, but initially failed to correct the location in the collateral description.

    The Late Fix: Four months later, First Niagara tried to fix the incorrect address in the collateral description. The borrower filed for bankruptcy 88 days after this fix.

    The Trustee's Power: Because US bankruptcy law allows a trustee to cancel (avoid) any transfer (or perfection of a security interest) made in the 90 days before the bankruptcy filing, the late fix was invalid.

    The Central Issue: The entire case then hinged on whether the original, incorrect, address-specific description was still legally valid under New York's UCC rules, specifically Section 9-504, which generally requires only a broad "all assets" statement.

3. The Court's Decision

    Argument 1 (The Address Limit): The trustee argued that by listing a specific address, the description limited the bank's lien only to assets at that location.

        The Ruling: The Court disagreed. It ruled that the "including, but not limited to" language showed the bank intended to illustrate the "all assets" blanket, not limit it.

    Argument 2 (Seriously Misleading): The trustee argued that the incorrect address made the filing "seriously misleading" to any other potential lender searching the records.

        The Ruling: The Court rejected this, finding no precedent (prior case) where a misleading illustrative detail was paired with an otherwise clear "all assets" description.

4. The Takeaway for Lenders

    A Win... But a Warning: First Niagara ultimately won its case and kept its security interest, but only after expensive and lengthy legal battles.

    The Advice: The clear message to lenders is: Avoid unnecessary details in "all assets" UCC-1 filings. Using a simple description like "All present and future assets of the Debtor" completely avoids the risk of future lawsuits and complications like the one First Niagara faced.

    A Final Note: The document also reminds lawyers that while "all assets" is fine for the public notice (UCC-1 financing statement), the actual loan agreement (security agreement) must still contain a more detailed list of collateral to legally create the security interest.

# Types of Debt 

**1. Senior Secure Debt:** All Bank Debt. It has first lien on either specific assets, or a blanket lien on all assets. In simple words, in a bankruptcy scenario they're the first ones to get paid.  (E.g. Senior Notes and Term Loans)

Term loans and seniornotes are identical to bonds except the amortization (plan to repay principal) structure.

For bonds the amortization plan is paying principal as a bullet (all at the end) while term notes and loans are under the partial amortization plan where they pay the principal periodically and then the remaining at the end.  

**Capital Providers: Where do you get this senior secured debt?**   

If you're a large corporation you get it from **corporate banks** 

If you're a mid corporation you get it from **commercial banks** 

**Public bonds** can also be senior secured.

If you're a company in distress (unable to secure financing elsewhere) you get it from **non-bank lenders** or private credit shops because no one else is liekly to lend you money. Hence, they are far more expensive than the others (they charge 5 to 6% more than the banks do.)

# Working Captial 



Bonds have bullet structures. 

Term notes and loans have partial amortization.
