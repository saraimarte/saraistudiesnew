Base Case Projection 

Definition: This represents your core, most likely, or "median" expectation for the company's performance over the projection period (typically five years).


Sensitized or Downside Projections 

Definition: This projection, often used interchangeably with "downside scenario," models the company's performance if a major, identifiable risk to the business model were to be realized.

Purpose: This scenario is crucial for developing your fixed income (credit) view. Since lenders are not rewarded for a company's upside, their primary concern is whether the borrower can withstand an economic downturn or business shock and still meet its debt obligations (i.e., whether the loan remains safe).

Key Requirement: The assumptions used in the sensitized case (e.g., lower revenue, margin contraction) must be logically and explicitly tied to a specific risk you have identified regarding the company's operations or market environment.
