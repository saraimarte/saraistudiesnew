1. Correct Don't overstate people lost points because of it. 

2. Read slides. 1 of these 6. Not npv, future value or present value. These are the things you bring up if you're presenting a bond to poeple. 

The first 5 are ways to reduce risk. Amoritzation, collateral, covenants, gurentees, tenor maturity.

3. He said as long as it was around the 20's for two years.

Anything between D and A Depreciation and amorrixation excluding... consilard stateemtn of cash flows (two ways to find DnA) and Changes is what you would add back as an adjustement. 

Adjustements are not just in P&L but also in cahs flow statment. 

4. It is not taxes, or interest or net income (why?) its revenue gross margin and operation expressions. 

DnA is not a valid reasoning. It deosnt affect EBIDTA. If you change it EBITDA stays the same. 

EBITDA op income + DnA 

op income change = changes in revenue and changes in gross margin and operation expenses (cost structure)


GPM = gross profit margin 

What did impact adj EBITDA not what could impact adj EBITDA use numbers. 

three areas of focus and if there is large adjustement then mention it.  

MDandA sessions not on midterms. You don't need it to answer this question.  
It's math.  

5. large change in any line item that should be a question. 

"Were there any nonreccurding expenses?" You can throw this question is always. 

"What portion of the company's SG&A is fixed vs variable?"

If everything is varaible thats good if they go on a downturn there is a lot of stuff they can cut off because only thing they have thats fixed that cant go away is salary and rent.  

The financials dont tell you if something is non reccuring or not unless its like obvious like litigation (one time law fees. )  



If key change is revenue increased/decreased or margins expanded ask why. 


In this class just focus on cash flow statement between dna and 


6. 
debt to ebitda increases risk increases 
debt to ebitda decreases risk descreases 

debt to ebtida = leverage 

its the number one factor that impacts ratings. 
and whether a bank will lend money to a company( bank wont lend to companeis with high ebitda)
and internal risk ratings a bank has. 

In quiz he was lintinet as long as you tied it in with something from the financials then okay but on exams hes looking specfic for the debt to ebitda ratio/leverage mention.

interview tip: mention leverage. 



Modelling 

What does flat mean? Dosn't change = stays the same 



Flat as a percent of revenue means find ____ as percent of revenue and have that be the same for all years. 

he could also say increase as a percent of sales. 

submit excel file so he could see your work. 

Put ANYTHING he said even its "complete nonsense" for leave. 

he will maybe add more line items on exam. 

12-13 questions of financial analysis  and modelling 

He gave formula in quiz but will not in exam memorize like AR AP and Inventory

Net profit = net income 

increase in asset is a use of cash so its decrease in cash.
decrease in asset is a gain? of cash so its increase in cash.

its working capital asset. 


For question 9 and 10 

impairment or any non cash expense he gives you you treat it the same way as DnA

If you say [...] treat it like accounts payable. 8:29pm 

Example of sending excel gives 90% instead of 20%. 

10. 
in the cash flow statement when you spend cash its negative if you gain gash its positive!!! so make sure your format is right.  

CAPEX - he could say its...

flat 

percent of last year pp and e 

or grow by some amount 



CFO = cash from operations


11. "How would it impact stock price" = "How would it impact future cash flows?"

[...]
price decreases = revenue decreases = gross margin decrease/contract

lower margins results in less free cash flow - stock decreases.


12. Revenue growth, operating expenses, gross margin and ebtida adjustements.
