**Def.** A **Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)** is a type of asset-backed security that is secured by a collection of mortgages. Investors in MBS receive periodic payments similar to bond coupon payments, which are backed from the cash flows generated by the mortgage loans.

# Types of MBS 

**1. Pass -Through Securities:** The most basic type of MBS where the principal and interest payments from the mortgages are collected and "passed through" to the MBS investors.
**2. Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs):** It's a "Customizable MBS." It's an MBS that gets cut up into pieces or tranches. The process of cutting up the MBS is called **tranching**. 


<RuleBox>
**Def.** **Tranching** is the process of dividing a MBS based on time or risk.  
</RuleBox>


## Two types of Tranching 

**1.** Credit Tranching:** Dividing the MBS based on risk levels. 

E.g. One party may want invest in an MBS but not loose any money at all so the bank will slice up the MBS by creating a "Safe Tranch" or "Senior Tranch" for the party to safely invest in. How? The safest tranche is safe from loosing money so the risk is low *because* the remaining tranche (the junior tranche) is the one loosing money if the mortgage holders default on their loans first. Because of the risk that the junior tranche is taking- they have a higher interest rate. 


**2.** Time Tranching:** Dividing the MBS based on time periods. 

E.g. One party may want their money back in 2 years so the bank will create a "2 year tranch" for that party to invest in. Another party may want their money back in 5 years so the bank will create a "5 year tranch" for that party to invest in. The 2 year tranch will get paid back first before the 5 year tranch. Because the 5 year tranch is waiting longer to get their money back- they have a higher interest rate.
Important Organizations in MBS 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** An **Agency MBS** is a mortgage-backed security that is created by one of following three government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the U.S. If an MBS is issued by any other issuer it is called a **Non-Agency MBS**.
</RuleBox>


**1.** Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae):** A U.S. government corporation that guarantees timely payments on MBS. Because they are a government agency doing this, it significantly reduces risk of loss. 

**2. Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae):** A private company created by the government that purchases mortgages from larger commercial banks, then guarantees these mortgages and sells them as MBS.

**3. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac):** Similar to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise that buys mortgages from (smaller) banks and packages them into MBS for sale to investors.



# Benefits of MBS for Lenders 

**1. Liquidity:** Take a bank who give loans for mortgages. If they give out a lot of capital for the mortgages they would have to wait many years for that capital to come back to them. By selling the mortgages, the bank can get the capital back immediately and use that capital to give out more loans. Additionally, they get rid of all the risk those mortgage loans. 

# Benefits of MBS for Investors  

**1. Trancing:** You have to reme


**2. Diversification:** There is lesser chance of loss when investing in a pool backed by 1,000 different mortgages, then investing in one mortgage  (E.g. Counter example: 2008.)



# Causes of 2008


*1. Increase in Non Agency MBS** 

**2. Looser underwriting standards for mortgages including low down payements**

Improper incentives in underwriting 

predatory lending non banks target low income minority communtiies 

large balloon payments due at matrutiy would lie to them say low montly payments
interest rates higher than verbally agreed to
