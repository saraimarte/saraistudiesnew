# What is a Derivative?

<RuleBox align = "left">
**Def.** A **derivative** is a <Pop t = "like stocks, bonds, currency, commodities, real estate "> financial instrument</Pop> that derives it's value from something else. 

We call that 'something else' an underlying asset or 'the underlying.' 

These underlying assets can be  <Pop t = "raw materials like oil, gas, gold, wheat, corn, soybeans"> commodities</Pop>, stocks, bonds, currency, or real estate. 

</RuleBox>

Some examples:

<ul>
    <li>A **stock derivative** is a derivative who's value is derived from a **stock**.</li>
    <li>A **bond derivative** is a derivative who's value is derived from a **bond**.</li>
    <li>A **commodity derivative** is a derivative who's value is derived from a **commodity**.</li>
</ul>

# Types of Derivatives 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **derivative,** physically, is just a <Pop t = "just a piece of paper">contract</Pop> between a buyer and a seller.
</RuleBox>

We have different types of contracts:

**1. Forward Contract:**  is a private contract agreement between two parties to buy and sell an asset at a specific price.    
**2. Futures Contract:**  is a forward contract but standardized, public, has guardrails, and is traded on an exchange.     
**3. Options Contract:**  is an agreement between two parties that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe.   
**4. Swaps Contract:**  


guardrails have subject to clearing and market requirements  version of a forward 

# Where are Derivatives Traded?

<RuleBox>
**Def.** An **exchange** is an organization that **provides a place for trading** financial instruments.  

It also sets the rules and procedures for how those financial instruments are traded. 
</RuleBox>

<RuleBox>
**Def.** We say that a deal is done **Over the Counter (OTC)** if it is a private deal between two parties. 
</RuleBox>

In summary,

<ul>
    <li>**Exchange:** Public Market/Public Deal</li>
    <li>**OTC:** Private Market/Private Deal</li>
</ul>

If you trade stocks, then you can trade in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
 
If you trade derivatives, you can trade either 


In the same way we have stock exchanges- we have derivative exchanges... where we can trade derivatives. 

But unlike a stock exchange where you can trade all stocks, there are only two derivatives that are traded in exchanges and those are futures and options. 

Futures are the only derivatives that are exclusively traded in exchanges because options can be traded in exchanges and OTC. 


There are two main derivative exchanges:

**1. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME):** where you can trade derivatives...  
**2. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE):** where you can trade derivatives ....
