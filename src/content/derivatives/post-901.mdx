# Lecture 1 Review in Lecture 2 

12:11 Lecture 1 Review   
Cash/Spot vs Derivative  
OTC (Firms usually do this not individuals) vs Exchange Clear (Something you can do yourself)  
Lehman Bankruptcy - 2008 Financial Crisis (Mostly OTC)
Types of Strategies (slide 11) Arb, Spec, Hedgers 

Arb Profit Seeking  | play a spot to derivative buy cheap spot and enter into future or option to sell higher than they bought then thats what they will do and they have to do this at the time time for low risk. Buy spot sell future.   
Spec Risk management profit seeking with little to no risk   
Hedgers not profit seeking just risk minimization  | use derivative as a proxy/leverage exposure to the underlying (when she says underlying its underlying asset ) \ strategy you play against some  other underlying exposure ( like exchange rate ?) "I have some dollar to pound risk and i need to minimize that risk whats the best way for me to do that? Change dollar to pound right now? or change dollar into pound as a derivative? " it gives you another opportunity 

Slide 27 Put is a derivative "derivative like a put"  loosing 50 cents per share is better than loosing $3 per share  | In the heding industry you're being paid to be the best looser. | "buy put" = "buy the right to sell"   

Slide 15 Forward vs Future 
Every derivative is a contract to transact later and you set terms of contract today, rules, price its going to mature at, maturity date.  

Forward vs Future vs Swap  
Swap is just a sequence of forwards  

Options 
Understand if when youre buying the option its a call or put 
you pay for the option/choice to [...] a premium
