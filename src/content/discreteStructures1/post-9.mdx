In the previous lesson we learned how to generate languages using grammar. 

In this lesson, we learn how to use machines to recognize languages. 

# DFA 

# NFA

# Finding Equivalent DFA to an NFA 

# Operations on Regular Languages 

Concatenation (𝐴𝐵)

Union (𝐴∪B)

Kleene star (𝐴<sup>*</sup>)

A regular expression is a compact pattern used to describe a regular language. It's made up of:

literals like 0 or 1

operators like:

∪ (union)

* (Kleene star = repeat 0 or more times)

? (optional, equivalent to union with ε)

parentheses to group


# Meely vs Moore
