Grammar - Phrase Structure Grammar 

<RuleBox align = "left">

G = (V, Σ, S, P) is a grammar where:  

**V (alphabet):** is a set of variables (aka the alphabet; it can include both terminal and non-terminal variables)         

**Σ (or T):** contains only terminals variables (your strings should only contain these variables at the end)  

**S:** is the start variable (the one you will use to start the derivation process)    

**P:** is a set of rules (productions) that describe how to form strings using the grammar   

Note: Variables can also be called symbols.

# Determine if a given string is in the language (With Derivation Tree)

## Using Top-Down Parsing 

## Using Bottom-Up Parsing (Not covered in this class)

# Determine the language of a grammar L(G)

# Find a context-free grammar for a given language 

# Construct derivation trees for a given string that is part of the language generated by a given grammar
