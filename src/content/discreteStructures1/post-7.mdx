# 9.1 & 9.3 | Relations: Representations, Properties, and Operations

STUDY BINARY RELATION

## Lecture Video (Representations and Properties)
Something cool we can do is study the relationships between elements in a set.

Ways to Represent Relations (Ordered Pairs, Tables, Graphs, and Matrices) [soon]

## Operations on Relations (Union, Intersection, Difference, Complement, Exclusive OR and Composition) Given Roster vs Matrix

# 9.4 | Closures of Relations

So far, we practiced identifying if a relation was reflexive, symmetric, or transitive. 

The phrases 'reflexive closure' or 'transitive closure' may sound complex or overwhelming but guess what?

It's *literally* taking any relation and just ... **making** it reflexive or transitive. 

How do we do that?

We just add the **minimum** amount of pairs needed to satisfy the property.

# 9.5 | Equivalence Relations

<RuleBox>
**Definition** An **equivalence relation** is one that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

# 9.5 | Equivalence Classes

<RuleBox>
**Definition** An **equivalence class** is one that groups elements of *a* set that are equivalent to a specific element a given what would make them equivalent.
</RuleBox>

# 9.6 | Partial Orderings (Partial Order)

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A **partial ordering** is a relation that is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. We denote a partial order relation by the symbol ⪯. This symbol is NOT a less than or equal to sign.
</RuleBox>

<RuleBox>
**Definition** Given a set A, if we find that a relation R (or ≤) on A is a partial order relation then we say, (A, R) or (A, ⪯) is a **partially ordered set (or poset).**
</RuleBox>

# 9.6 | Total Orderings (Total Order)

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A **total order set** is one that (a) is a partial order relation and (b) (a,b) ∈ R ('All pairs in the relation R') should be comparable
</RuleBox>

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A pair (a,b) is **comparable** if a is related to b or b is related to a. In other words if (a,b) ∈ R or (b,a) ∈ R.
</RuleBox>

## 9.6| Well-Ordering Posets 

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A  well-ordering poset is one that is (a) total ordering set and (b) every non-empty subset of A has a minimum element.
</RuleBox>

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A  well-founded poset is one that has a minimum element (doesn't decrease indefinitely)
</RuleBox>
