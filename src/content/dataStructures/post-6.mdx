# Doubly/Double Linked Lists

Doubly Linked Lists are lists that contain nodes that not only point to the next node but has a pointer to the previous node. 

Which is why we call them double linked lists. The nodes contain double the pointers. 

So far we have only been able to add and remove a node from the beginning of a linked list. 

But since with doubbly linked lists we have access to the nodes before and after a specfic node, we are able to insert and remove any node we specify.  

In the following video, we will talk through coding a doubly linked list in Java and it's methods.  

# addFirst()

# deleteFirst()

# addAfter()

# delete()

# traverse()


# Circular Linked Lists
