# 2-3 Trees

## Concept & Vocabulary 

The problem with binary search trees is that they can become unbalanced, leading to long, 'linky' chains of nodes. 

This unbalancing makes the tree expensive for searching. 

The goal of 2-3 trees is to maintain balance, ensuring that all paths from the root to a null link (leaf) are the same length. This keeps the tree height balanced, making search, insertion, and deletion operations more efficient (cheaper.)

## Numbers to Tree (Constructing a 2-3 Search Tree)

<Rulebox>

**1.** Insertion happens from the bottom.

**2.** A 2-node needs to have 2 children.

**3.** A 3-node needs to have 3 children. 

So, every time you add a number make sure you did it from the bottom and that both **2** and **3** are still true.

# Red Black Trees

The idea is that we want to represent 2-3 trees as binary trees. 

We can represent a 2-node (1 key inside a node) in binary...because that's all binary is. 

The problem is we have no way to represent a 3-node (2 keys inside the node) in binary. 

The solution we came up with is to represent a 3-node with a red link. 

Let's see this in action.
