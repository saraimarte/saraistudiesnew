import Code from '@components/Code.astro';

All programs will use some memory.

Every data structure will be stored somewhere. 

# Data Structures

## Array

Let's call the array 'a'.

a is a reference to the first position of the array in memory. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "fileName.java" 
code = {   
`int[] a; //declaring an array
a = new int[8]; //initilizing an array
`
}/>
