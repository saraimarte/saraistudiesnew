Hash Tables is a specific way to create a dictionary.

If you think about a dictionary, it's just a collection of words and their definitions. 

Similarly, we have keys and values that we're dealing with. 

Watch the video below until 5:16 as a perfect intro into hash tables and the collision problem.

Here, you're able to see that the problem is collisions. 

There are two solutions. You can build a hash table that uses seperate chaining to resolve the collision or linear probing. 

# How to deal with collisions?

We will have two seperate implementations for hash tables one for each solution for collisions, seperate chaining and linear probing.

# Seperate Chaining 

## With Rehashing
