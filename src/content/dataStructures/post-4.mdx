# Intro

Do you remember in 111 where they had us insert an element at the beginning of an array?

We would have to access each element and move it down one. 

If we had n elements then we would have to do that n times hence the time complexity is in order of n times or O(n).

The question is, is there another data structure we can use where it will take less time to insert an element at the beginning of it?

The answer is, yes! It's called a linked list.
