# Intro

Do you remember in 111 where they had us insert an element at the beginning of an array?

We would have to access each element and move it down one. 

If we had n elements then we would have to do that n times hence the complexity would be O(n).

The question is, is there another data structure we can use where it will take less time to insert an element at the beginning of it?

The answer is, yes! It's called a linked list. 

A linked list is a data structure where we can only add to the beginning of the list and only remove from the beginning of the list. 

So we don't have to traverse the whole list like we do an array in order to move everything over. 

Either watch the following video or just read!

# Linked List: The Idea

A linked list is made up of nodes linked to eachother.

A **node** is just a box. 

This box contains two things **(1)** the **data** it will hold **(2)** and a pointer which *points* to the **next** <s>box</s> node.

A linked list starts with an empty node that points to nothing- to null - like so, 

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = ""/>

Now, this box (node) does not exist yet in our Java world but we can create this object. 

Recall: classes can go above or below the main method but never inside. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{` private static class Node { //create data type Node and tell it...
    private String item;  //"You will have an item that will always be a String-this is your data"
    private Node next; //"You will have a pointer called 'next' that will point to the next node"
}`}>
</Code>

Now, that we created a Node object, we can use this in our linked list object that we will create.

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`public static class LinkedList{

//(1) create a Node called first
//this will create an empty Node with empty data/item and it will point to nothing
private Node first = null; // The first node in the list

// Adds a new node to the beginning of the list
public void addFirst(String item){
    Node temp = new Node(); //(2) create a temporary node (the new node we want to add)
   
    temp.item = item; //(2) add the item to it's data box
 
    temp.next = first; //(3) make the temporary node's pointer point to the current first node that points to nothing right now
  
    first = temp; //(4) then make the firstNode equal to the temporary node. Now, the node you wanted to add becomes the first node in the linked list.
}
}`}>
</Code>

<ImageMd img = {img7} alt = ""/>

Now, let's finish some other methods. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`//check if linked list is empty method 
public boolean isEmpty(){
    return first == null; // will return true if first node does not exist; false if it does exist
}

//get size of the linked list method
public int size(){
    return size;
}

// delete node method
public String deleteFirst(){

String item = first.item; // get item I want to delete

first = first.next; // first node will now refer to what the current first node is pointing to (that is, the second node.) In other words, we're making the second node the first node now.

return item; //return what I deleted
}`}>
</Code>

That's it! Now you can use this data type and it's methods in your main method.

Let's create our first linked list and have it hold the nodes Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward and Mary. Then delete Mary. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`public static void main(String[] args){

  // Create new linked list
  String myList = new LinkedList();

  // Check size of linked list - should be 0 since there are no nodes inside.
  System.out.println("size=" + myList.size());

  // Add 3 nodes
  myList.addFirst("Spongebob");
  myList.addFirst("Patrick");
  myList.addFirst("Squidward");
  myList.addFirst("Mary");

  //Check size of linked list now, should be 3
  System.out.print(myList.deleteNode()); //Mary

}`}>
</Code>

This is what your linked list looks like

<ImageMd img = {img5} alt = ""/>

# Practice

First, I suggest attempting to write the code above from scratch until you got it then feel free to attempt the following problems. 

**1.** Add an **isEmpty()** method that will return a boolean true if the linked list is empty, false when it is not empty.

<Solution>

First, you ask yourself "What does it mean for a linked list to be empty?" 

Well, the only time the list is empty is when the First node is null. 

In other words it's pointing to null- to nothing...to no other node.

And that only happens when there are nodes. 

Even if we have a lot of nodes, if we pop all of them, the first node will end up pointing to null again. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`public boolean isEmpty(){
    return first == null;
}`}>
</Code>

</Solution>


**2.** Add a **traverse()** method that will traverse through the linked list items and return them.

<Solution>
<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`public void traverse(){
    while(!isEmpty()){
        System.out.println(first.item);
        first = first.next;
    }
}`}>
</Code>
</Solution>
