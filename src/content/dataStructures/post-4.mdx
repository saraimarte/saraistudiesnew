# Intro

Do you remember in 111 where they had us insert an element at the beginning of an array?

We would have to access each element and move it down one. 

If we had n elements then we would have to do that n times hence the time complexity is in order of n times or O(n).

The question is, is there another data structure we can use where it will take less time to insert an element at the beginning of it?

The answer is, yes! It's called a linked list. 

# Linked List: The Idea

A linked list is made up of nodes linked to eachother.

A **node** is just a box. This box contains two things- the data and a pointer which *points* to the next <s>box</s> node.

Currently, since there is only one node in the linked list, the first one is pointing to <s>nothing</s> null.

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = ""/>

Now, this box does not exist yet in our Java world but we can create this object. 

Recall: classes can go above or below the main method but never inside. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{` private class Node { //create data type Node and tell it...
    private String item;  //"You will have an item that will always be a String-this is your data"
    private Node next; //"You will have a pointer called 'next' that will point to the next node"
}`}>
</Code>

Now, that we created a Node object, we can use this in our linked list object. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`public class LinkedList{

//(1) create a Node called first
//this will create an empty Node with empty data/item and it will point to nothing

private Node first;

//have the linked list start with a size of 0
private int size = 0;

//so every time we want to add a new node...
public void addFirst(String item){
    Node temp = new Node; //(2) create new temporary node
   
    temp.item = item; //(2) add the item to it's data box
 
    temp.next = first; //(3) make the temporary node's pointer point to the current first node that points to nothing right now
  
    first = node; //(4) then make the firstNode equal to the temporary node. Now, the node you wanted to add becomes the first node in the linked list.

    size++; //add 1 to the size of the linkedlist since you added another node
}
}`}>
</Code>

<ImageMd img = {img7} alt = ""/>

Now, let's finish some other methods. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`//check if linked list is empty method 
public boolean isEmpty(){
    return first == null; // will return true if first node does not exist; false if it does exist
}

//get size of the linked list method
public int size(){
    return size;
}

// delete node method
public String deleteFirst(){

String item = first.item; // get item I want to delete

first = first.next; // first node will now refer to what the current first node is pointing to (that is, the second node.)

size--; //since you deleted a node, the size of the linkedlist went down

return item; //return what I deleted
}`}>
</Code>

That's it! Now you can use this data type in your main method.

Let's create our first linked list and have it hold the nodes Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "LinkedList.java" code = 
{`public static void main(String[] args){

  // Create new linked list
  String myList = new LinkedList();

  // Check size of linked list - should be 0 since there are no nodes inside.
  System.out.println("size=" + myList.size());

  // Add 3 nodes
  myList.addFirst("Spongebob");
  myList.addFirst("Patrick");
  myList.addFirst("Squidward");

  //Check size of linked list now, should be 3
  System.out.println("size=" + myList.size());

}`}>
</Code>

<ImageMd img = {img5} alt = ""/>

# Stacks 

Stacks is another data structure- think about a stack of books.

You can stack one book on top of another but when you want to remove one you have to start from the top. 

There are only two methods we need to do for the stack data structure- push and pop aka add and delete. 

Actually, we already built a stack. A linked list is a stack.

It's a data structure where when we add a node, we add it to the top and when we want to delete a node we have to delete the first/top one. 

Really, you can simply replace the addFirst() and delteFirst() names with push() and pop() because they're the exact same thing.

Either way, let's go over a stack class.
