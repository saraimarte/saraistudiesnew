Welcome to data structures where all we learn is, well, data structures. 

A data structure is a way to organize your data.

You already are an expert at a data structure - an array!

Arrays (and arraylists) are the only data structures you covered in Compsci 111.

For an array, we learned that we can store data into boxes and each of these boxes have an index that acts as an address to the data in the box.

Now, at the very end of Compsci 111, you learned how to use ArrayList. 

But, that's the point.

You just  learned how to *use* it.

The ArrayList data structure came with methods like .add() and .remove(), but you never knew where they came from or how they worked. You just knew that you had access to them and you could use them.

You didn’t design the ArrayList or figure out how it handles searching, adding, or removing elements.

That changes in this class.

Here, we’ll go beyond simply using data structures — we’ll build them from the ground up.

We will learn how to implement insert, delete and search methods for each of these data structures so that other users can use them just like you used an array list and it's methods.
