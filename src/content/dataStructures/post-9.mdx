Priority queues are like queues where the primary concern is not the order of insertion, but the priority of elements.

Unlike a regular queue (first-in-first-out) or stack (last-in-first-out), a priority queue allows us to always access either the largest or smallest element first.

A common analogy is an emergency room where the most critical patient (highest priority) is treated first, regardless of arrival order.

Priority queues support two main operations: insert (adding an element with a priority) and delete-max/min (removing the highest or lowest priority element).

A binary heap is a complete binary tree structure that supports the idea of a priority queue.

There are two different types of binary heap trees- min and max heap trees. 

Let's talk about them.
