Imagine you're in a Netflix competition.

The current challenge is to get through a maze.

This maze has a lot of entrances. One entrance has no way out. 

You were the winner of the last challenge so you're allowed to ask for one hint. 

Your'e showed the entrances and you ask the host, "Which entrance has no way out?"

What's the host's answer?

Well, first, they should already have the answer before the challenge even starts but what did they have to do beforehand to get that answer?

Did they take 50 hours doing trial and error walking different ways to see if the path to the exit exists or... do they use the union-find algorithm???

They use the union-find algorithm!

This algorithm, tells the host if there's a connection from each entrance to the exit.

So, the host would have had to run the algorithm for each entrance and it would tell the host if the path exists or not.

The host would then know which path has no way out and would be able to tell you!

Now, the host is a computer scientist by night so they would not have just used this algorithm, they would have written it from scratch.

So, let's do the same. Let's rewrite this algorithm from scratch.

There are three versions of the algorithm you will have to learn for the exam: (1) QuickFind, (2) QuickUnion and (3)QuickUnion with Weights

First, let's watch us manually apply the algorithm and then we will translate these steps into code. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "QuickFind.java" code = 
{`public class QuickFind {

    private int[]id;

    public QuickFindUF(int n){
        id = new int[n];

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            id[i] = i;
        }
        public int find(int p){
            return id[p]
        }

        public void union(int p, int g){
            pid = id[p];
            gid = id[g];
            
            for(int i = 0; i < id.length; i++){
                if(id[i] = pid) id[i] = gid;
            }
        }
    }
}`}>
</Code>
