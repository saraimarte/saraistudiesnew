  <p>Let's play a game. It's called connect the dots.</p>
  <p>I tell you which dots you want connected and you connect them. Ready?</p>
</F>

<F>
  <p>These dots are really called vertices and the lines you connect them with are called edges.</p>
</F>

<F>
  <p>But what if I give you a billion vertices and ask you to connect them in the order I want? You don't have time for that, so you let the computer do it.</p>
</F>

<F>
  <p>But first, you have to tell the computer how to do it.</p>
  <p>So, how do we solve this problem?</p>
  <p>Using the union-find algorithm.</p>
