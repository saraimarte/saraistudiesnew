Let's play a game. It's called connect the dots. 

I tell you which dots you want connected and you connect them. Ready?

These dots are really called verticies and the lines you connect them with are called edges. 

But what if I give you a billion verticies and I ask you to connect them in the order I want? You don't have time for that so you let the computer do it. 

But first, you have to tell the computer how to do it. 

So, how do we solve this problem? 

Using the union-find algorithm.






<Code lang = "java" fileName = "QuickFind.java" code = 
{`public class QuickFind {

    private int[]id;

    public QuickFindUF(int n){
        id = new int[n];

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            id[i] = i;
        }
        public int find(int p){
            return id[p]
        }

        public void union(int p, int g){
            pid = id[p];
            gid = id[g];
            
            for(int i = 0; i < id.length; i++){
                if(id[i] = pid) id[i] = gid;
            }
        }
    }
}`}>
</Code>

# QuickFind 

It's in the name. This is the quick find version of the algorithm. 

# QuickUnion

This is the quick union version of this algorithm.
