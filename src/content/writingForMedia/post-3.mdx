# Instructions



Write a short and fun news piece (300-350 words) based on the data found in the <a href = "https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/">Social Security Administration's baby names dataset.</a>

Savan had us come up with 2 ideas for the piece. Here is what I posted. In red, is her feedback. 



**1.** I can analyze the trend of vintage names making a comeback in the 21st century. I can focus on names that were popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s, fell out of favor, and are now experiencing a revival. For example, names like "Hazel," "Theodore," and "Eleanor" could be explored. I already checked out "Eleanor" and there is a clear trend. "Eleanor" was popular 1900's to 1937 where the popularity started falling. Then, it's popularity picked back up in 1987 and in 2023 it ranked 14 in most used name, the most popular it's ever been! That's so interesting- it's literally a prime example of how vintage names are making a comeback.



**2.** I can analyze the influence of influencers (pun intended) on baby names. For example, the name "Anastasia".  Anastasia Kingsnorth is an influencer and when looking through the data, the name has only become popular recently.

Both are strong ideas. There might be more to work with in #1 (fascinating about Eleanor! Why? Of course, see where the name was during and since Eleanor Roosevelt). 



#2 could work if you have at least three influencers' names to trace in the SSA list and if they can kind of be linked to that influencers' names. Since influencers are a relatively new thing, how many parents would have been influenced?



This goes for everyone and for most of the ideas: you don't have definitively prove anything (because you can't: correlation isn't causation), but you still want to do as much correlation as you can.
