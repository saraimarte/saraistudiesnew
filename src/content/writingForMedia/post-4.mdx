I did this last minute (as in 1 hour before 11:59 p.m.,) so it's not like I could have interviewed someone from any club or something because it was too late so I wrote about something that happened in the past (in March, we're in June) (because I had quotes from people regarding the topic) which we're not even suppose to do since our pieces have to be timely- (aka recent) - but I figured it was worth the few points taken off.
