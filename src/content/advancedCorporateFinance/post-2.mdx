If there is a sustainable advantage and its not a long term one then its a weakness. 

are revenues driven by relationship or not?

## Weakness 

No barriers to entry at 20% growth => what's the likehood big dog is going to move in 


70% leverage ratio clarkson
0% leverage ratio (almost no debt)  apple

## Threats

84 lumber the west coast version of home depot does a Revenue vaccum 

how do you survive revenue vaccum? equity. goal: less debt.

73% leverage ratio => a lot of debt=> how to get rid of it? => raise money => raise equity => whos going to fund this guy? theres no barriers to entry

he should have raised money at the start! 

he needs money 





#  Funds flow statement 

where is the money coming from and how did you spend it?

If you get $$$$
goal: spend it on AR, inventory 
i dont want to see it on ....

If an asset goes up its a use of funds
If an asset goes down its credit 

If liability goes up its a source of cash 


slide 5 just look at 

two balance sheets next to eachother and look at assets..
 
 DU
 CS

if revenues is growing do you need more receivables? revenues (sales)
what about   

Net worth is equity for private company- equity is for chapter c corp.

Net worth is a use rn .. did it go up or down... net worth is liability => use is when net worth was debited => debit on a liability balance accoutn is a decreaase

1:02:00 Why is equity negative 

1:06:26 True or False question if S goes up and AR goes up 10.4% 38 days Oustnading is the same 38 days but its not... 

THREE REASONS WHY THIS HAPPENS

3.  

1:11:15 Inventory Terms 
 
E.g. slide 23 case where inventory is not growing with cogs...so he switched to slower turning inventory but that means... 

e.g.. rutgers example more students (growth) but no investtment in more classes, staff etc.  

# 1:16:.. slide 26 A = L + E

apple never needs debt 

startup company sell stock

We make money by providing L and E 

 2 colin example from exam 1
 

 note payable trade happens when you are pissing your suppliers off


 SLIDE 28 IMPORTANT 

 # What creates the huge appetite for cash?


 If you are lumber yard you should have 50% leverage ratio 

40-60 % range is okay as long as you bring it back to 50% 

# How you prospect/look for good customers 
 We look for firms who have these characteristics to be OUR (we are loan officers) customers :

**1.** Rapid sales growth 

expansion capex is driven by capacity 

**2. A long cash flow conversion cycle**

**3. Low profit retention**

Our job is to finance it with the right mix of debt and equity. 


1:39:41 look at leverage ratio 


1:41:08 Disease is not growth it's inability to manage growth

SLIDE 38  sustained growth menas i dont need extra capitla because my retained earnings are fast enough

2. var can they? no
3. fix can they? no
4. taxes  can they? no

so type 2 diabetes not terminal though 

SOLUTION: raise capital at reasonable debt to equity ratio 

if he does take more debt (which you can't) what would he do next year? ask for more money. and the next? more money. 

slide 34 don't need to memorize it

sustainable growth rate is driven by retained earnings 

payout ratio what % of your retained earnings are you keeping





ex. all growth in revenue but hes dead a walking zombie 


1:50:30 slide 37
