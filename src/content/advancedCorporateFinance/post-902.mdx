COGS should be inline with sales 



check... 
credit is source of funds
debit is use of funds



Things to cover: 

inelastic demand (if i raise prices there is no impact on revenue)

The last thing you want is elastic demand (why??)

Fixed costs doesn't require volumes to scale 
(!! Not on exam Explain LIFO/FIFO/0/1930/COGS will be really small relative to sales LIFO layer on inventory)

back
Most things in a financial model, are a function of sales or cog and cogs is a function of quantity which is part of revenue.  back


News vs Accountants Analogy (CNN vs Fox , 1 Accountant vs another accountant)

COGS is function of quantity ... 

Growth rate in price  and growth rate in quantity 

"unless..."
 
total growth rate = (1+g<sub>p</sub>)(1+g<sub>q</sub>)  P = f(q) q = q(p)

comparative advantage = nobody can steal your customers today (monopolists)= fat gross margin = nice EBITDA margin 

**How to maintain a competitive advantage?**  Not on test but this is what you learn in business policy.

"qtips good word for you"

E.g. Don't buy a car from a company thats going to go bankrupt. Why not if you can get it for cheap? 

Because then when a part in the car breaks... who are you going to call? The manufacture closed down! 


how he views EBITDA 

Cash Sales/Net sales - Cash Cogs (b/c accountants bundle depreciation into COGS.    








(... fix left hand side vs right hand side of the ?? )back 
near above or below EBIT line


The higher the difference in Market value and Liquidation Value the BLANK (higher/lower)? is is on the balance sheet 


# Commitments & Contingencies (Future Liabilities)

**1. Commitments:** are non-cancelable obligations to do something in the future (e.g. pay money, provide services, deliver goods, etc.)  

<ul>
    <li>**How does it appear?** It's not a dollar value. It's a simple disclosure of the liabilities the company *will* (because of a contract) have in the future. </li>
    <li>**Where does it appear?** In a footnote in the financial statements (almost always 10k; rarely ever 10q). Not as a liability. Why?</li>
    <li>**Why is this not considered a liability?** Because it's a future liability and under GAAP we don't record future liabilities in the balance sheet. Under GAAP, a liability is only recorded when an exchange of value has actually taken place so if the company hasn't received what they will liable for then...there's no liability so no change in the balance sheet.</li>
    <li>**In what document do you see these in?** 10ks. You will most likely never see this in a 10q, 10q is not audited so company will not disclose this info. But in 10k you will see it because the auditor wont sign up unless you disclose that. </li>
    <li>**Pre-2019**(Pre 2019 this would be in operating leases) After 2019 it shows up as contiengeis and commitements as a footnote</li>
    <li>**Red Flag:** If you see this in the financial statements it's a red flag- it means there is danger and you should look into it because it's something big. </li>
</ul>

Some examples, 

**E.g.** Today, you enter into a contract with Walmart to buy $50,000 worth of apples in 2 years. What happens to the balance sheet?

<Solution>
Nothing! You just made a promise you will be liable for those $50,000 in the future. 

You haven't received the apples yet so you owe nothing therefore are liable for nothing.

So, this will just be a footnote in your financial statements.  
</Solution>

**E.g.** In 2 years, you receive the apples and you pay on credit. What happens to the balance sheet? 

<Solution>
Well, now that you got the benefit (the apples) you are now liable for the cost of those apples. 

We *now* have a liability. 

Your accounts payable goes up because you now owe Walmart $50,000. 

</Solution>

**2. Contingencies:** are usually potential liabilities from lawsuits. 

Arthur Anderson was the accounting firm that represented ENRON and the reason they don't exist anymore is because the judgement against them by the jury was more than the enterprise value of the firm.  

Until the judge actually hit her dabble on the bench and confirmed how much Arthur Anderson was liable for... Arthur Anderson was not liable for *anything* and so they didn't need to record any liabilities. 

What does this mean for investors back then?

If they just looked at the financial statements, (and also ignored all the news lol) they would have no idea that such a tremendous liability was coming hence the

SOX Act of 2002 was passed because of this whole ENRON scandal and it required that off-balance sheet obligations and contingencies be disclosed in the financial statements. 

Because otherwise, what firm would want to disclose that they made a promise to pay millions of dollars in the future or that they are in a lawsuit where they are 99% certain they will loose and have to pay millions of dollars? 

If they didn't need to do that, they wouldn't. 

back ... idk if contingencies are required to be disclosed 

So SOX forced them to so that investors can make more informed decisions by seeing the hidden risks that could potentially bankrupt a company before those risks actually hit the balance sheet.

After all, that's what happened to Arthur Anderson, their financials were doing just fine and suddenly they go bankrupt because the value of the judgement against them was more than what the company was worth.  

So... it would be nice to know if companies are involved in any lawsuits hence the contingencies footnotes. 

And of course, just like commitments, if you see contingencies in the statements- it's a red flag.
