<h1 style = "color:red">Cash is King</h1>

# Balance Sheet 

The most valuable asset in the balance sheet is perishable inventory 
- Only asset you know when it's going to 0.
- Its always either book value or 0

- Why? When and that the value will go to 0 E.g. Milk 

Missing something (...)


# Income Statement 


Problem: Firm is not profitable. 

1. Can I raise my price? Can we create barriers to entry?  
2. Can I cut variable costs? (Is it going to make a difference? It depends on ...)  
3. Can I cut fixed costs/functional costs (in Europe)?  
4. Can I cut taxes?   

Things to cover: 

inelastic demand (if i raise prices there is no impact on revenue)

The last thing you want is elastic demand (why??)

Fixed costs doesn't require volumes to scale 

# Cash Flow Statement 


# Slide 5 


Higher up on Balance sheet - the more liquid the asset 

The higher the difference in Market value and Liquidation Value the BLANK (higher/lower)? is is on the balance sheet 

Balance sheet items can go down in value never up. 

# Slide 10

Cash Flow = EBITDA - Capex - Change in Working Capital 

Financial Statements don't tell us what we need to know 

# Questions

The most important thing on the balance sheet is the date.

Marketable sequirties next (Foreien Bears risk bc of foreign exchange rate and transaction costs)


Cash Account goes up > Use of Funds > Debit   What's in your pocket? Nothing its in the (...) debit bucket 
Cash Account goes down > Source of Funds > Credit    What's in your pocket? $100


# Slide 29 

Pecking order theory ... excess cash ...


Compensating Balance : putting savings up for collateral 

Mortgaage: If you want to borrow against a house : putting up your house for collateral 


# Slide 31 Marketabel Secrutiieis (Liquid in 24 hrs )

Where you park money that you don't need now but you know you're going to need. 

If its not an asset that you can't monetize within 24 hours  in  a day with almost no risk it shouldn't be in marketbale securities. It should be considered a long term investment.  

When you see a firm builing up marketable securitites ask what are they saving up for? Usually an aquisition. 

# Slide 32 Accounts Receivable 

On exam : what drives what. 

def: sales that are not collected. ( IOU "I owe you money") 
0 interest loan  

Ex. Paying roomatate back $20 on friday that you borowed on tuesday thats an IOU. you pay $20 not $2o + interest. Its a 0 interest loan.  

AR is an asset that earns nothing... 

Sales drive AR. 

AR is the only thing on the balance sheet driven by sales. 

# Slide 33 Allowance for Doubtful Receivables

Allowance for Doubtful Receivables is a percentage of sales

If you see that they are 5% this year, 10% next year,  15% the following year then something is wrong they are playing a game with the numbers.  

Should be a stable 


We have $1m in inventory but we think 200k wont sell.

# Slide 34 Inventory 

Inventroy is driven by COGS (raw material + labor) not sales. 

Sales is price and quantitiy. 

Quantiity drives inventory. 

What are things that mess with the value of inventory? 

1. Perishability 

2. Obsolescence (seasons bathing suits brazil etc.)

3. Idiosyncratic Inventory (inventory thats unique to one customer and if she doens't buy it what are you going to do with it? E.g. Only 4 people that will buy that $30k guitar. E.g. Guitar that has inititals of un juan de lo palotes. )

E.g. Don't buy a car from a company thats going to go bankrupt. 


# Slide 38 Inventoroy is reported at...
E.g. Comic worth 10 cents becaues that was the historical price but its worth $10m today. 

Impariment - write down inventory debit equity goes down the amount of inventory 

inventory goes down
equity goes down 
equity goes up?

# Slide 39 Prepaid Expenses 

What drives prepaid? COGS. 


On Exams: What drives what??


What drives value of patents? R&D  

Trademarks, copyright franchises are all driven by marketing.
