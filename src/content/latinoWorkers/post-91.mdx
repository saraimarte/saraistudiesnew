# Assignment Instructions

Type: Writing Assignment

We needed to answer questions about the Farmingville video:

**1.** We had to look at the steps taken by Farmingville residents and identify which actions made the conflict worse or better. We also had to think about how things could have been done differently to resolve the conflict.

**2.** We had to discuss why people might turn from just talking to using violence, based on a woman's statement in the film. We needed to consider if the arrest of students for arson and hate crimes was expected, and what caused the violence—whether it was the day laborers, the community's reaction, or something else. We also needed to explore if there is a clear difference between "verbal violence" and "physical violence" and how they might be connected.

**3.** We needed to connect what we learned from Farmingville to organizing Latino workers and the week’s readings.
