# Assignment Instructions

Type: Final

The final is broken up into the final exam (20% of your final grade) and a final writing assignment (10% of your final grade.)

For the paper we just had to pick a recent article about any topic you had not written about in a forum or writing assignment yet and connect all sources from that topic/unit to that article.
