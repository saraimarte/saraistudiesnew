This course examines the experiences of the diverse groups of Latino workers in the United States’ labor market through a review of current scholarship in this field.  As part of this process, students will investigate a current issue significant to the Latino workforce in the U.S. and prepare a Power Point presentation that summarizes their findings and reflects their position on the issue.

Choose your issue. Select a current issue significant to the Latino workforce in the U.S. Once your topic is selected, you should do some research on the subject matter. While you may already have an opinion on your topic and an idea about which side of the argument you want to take, you need to ensure that your position is well supported. Listing out the pros and cons/sides of the topic will help you examine your ability to support your counterclaims, along with a list of supporting evidence for both sides.
 
Before you begin your project, familiarize yourself with how to write a position paper, there are many sources on-line that can be found through a simple Google search.  Remember that your job on this project is to take one side of an issue and persuade your audience (me) that you are knowledgeable on the issue and you can support your position with evidence.  You must also be able to discuss the opposing position and refute their claims with research-based evidence.  You must cite all your sources.  Your sources (minimum of 10) should come from academic, popular (reputable) and on-line research. 

Remember, when you choose your topic to ask yourself whether there are two identifiable positions in your topic and whether you can clearly articulate your position.  Also, consider whether there is enough research and evidence to support your position.

**Project Requirements**

Slides and Notes Page Requirements- The minimum number of content Power Point slides is 16.  Let’s try to keep the maximum number at around 30. This maximum number does not include the title page, content divider slides or the bibliography.

Your Issue Position Power Point Project should be written with a persuasive and confident tone (although you must always back up your position(s) with research and facts – not just opinion!).

The following is a template for arranging your Power Point Project. **This template is not a suggestion!**  If you arrange your project as closely as possible to this template, you will ensure that you have included all the necessary elements of your project. 


**1.**    Introduction/Background (four-six slides)

a.     Introduce the topic

b.     Background information/details surrounding the issue

c.     Your view on the issue

**2.**   Alternative Positions/Opposing Positions (The opposite of your position!)(four-six slides)

a.     Detailed discussion of alternative/opposing positions

b.     Provide supporting information for alternative positions

c.     Detailed discussion of reason(s) for writer’s position (refute the counterclaims – why you disagree with opposing position)

d.     Provide evidence for your argument

**3.**   Your Argument (four-six slides)

a. Assert point #1 (#2, #3…) of your claims

b. Give your opinion

c. Provide support

**4.**   Summary and Conclusion (four-six slides)

a.     Restate the importance of the issue

b.     Restate your position

c.     Mention additional research/discovery needed from others that would be helpful to furthering knowledge on the issue

**5.**    Works cited (one slide)

**Other Requirements**

You must include a notes file with your Power Point Presentation.  Your notes page tells me what you cannot in your slides.  If this were a face-to-face class, you would present your power point with some details and discussion not presented on the slides.  Your notes pages will take the place of these details and discussion. This should be a separate word file submitted with your powerpoint. Do not use the notes feature in powerpoint.
