# Assignment Instructions

Type: Project

This week we only had to submit the course project topic and contract.

The course project topic requires the topic and a little description/summary of what you're going to write about specifically.

The course contract only needed to include three things: what role each student will play in the group project, who will complete which sections and who will submit the project. Since, I did the project by myself, mine looked a little different:
