# Assignment Instructions

Type: Forum

We had to find one example of an issue related to either spatial or skills mismatch and connect this example to *all* sources from this week (250 words min). It could have been from the news, journal article, website, etc. Also, make sure you add a link to the article you choose and provide a brief summary of that article.
Then, respond to another student's post (100 words min).

The Spatial Mismatch Between Jobs and Residential Locations Within Urban AreasLinks to an external site.
The study provides a specific example of a potential spatial mismatch issue in Atlanta during the 1980s. The study analyzes employment and population data for the Atlanta region, dividing it into five areas: northern suburbs, northern section of the central city, southern section of the central city (majority Black), Black southern suburbs, and white southern suburbs. The data reveals a concentration of jobs, across all industry groups, in the predominantly white northern suburbs, while the Black population is concentrated in the southern section of the central city and the Black southern suburbs.

The study highlights that this disparity in the spatial distribution of jobs and the Black population is not necessarily indicative of a spatial mismatch on its own, as the white population, competing for the same jobs, is also heavily concentrated in the northern suburbs. However, analyzing the changes in job distribution and population density between 1980 and 1990 reveals a potential spatial mismatch issue emerging.

During the 1980s, Atlanta experienced a northward shift in jobs, with the northern suburbs' share of jobs increasing significantly. Simultaneously, Black suburbanization, while occurring in both northern and southern suburbs, did not keep pace with the northward job movement. Furthermore, the suburbanization of the white population, particularly those with no more than a high school education, exhibited a strong bias towards the northern suburbs.

The study calculates a job access measure for less-educated workers, using the ratio of jobs suitable for them to the number of less-educated adults residing in each area. While acknowledging limitations in comparing this measure across areas, the study posits that changes over time within a specific area can indicate shifts in job access. The analysis reveals that the southern section of the central city, with a high concentration of Black residents, was the only area to experience a loss of jobs for less-educated workers between 1980 and 1990. This finding, combined with the northward shift in jobs and white population, suggests a potential worsening of spatial mismatch for Black residents in the southern section of the central city during the 1980s.
