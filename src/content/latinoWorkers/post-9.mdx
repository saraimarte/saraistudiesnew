# Assignment Instructions

Type: Forum

We had to find an article about immigrant complementarity or competition and provide a link or attach it. In our initial post, we needed to summarize the article in at least 250 words and ask a question for our classmates. For response posts, we read and responded to classmates’ articles in at least 100 words each. We had separate deadlines for initial and response posts, and posting everything in one day would lead to a 10-point deduction. Initial posts submitted late would lose an additional 5 points.

Article Chosen: <a href = "https://www.nber.org/papers/w19315"> Immigrants' and Native Workers: New Analysis on Longitudinal Data by Mette Foged and Giovanni Peri.</a>

In discussing the role of immigrants in the U.S. labor market, it's crucial to understand their impact on both native workers and the overall economy. The Brookings article highlights how immigrants often occupy roles that complement rather than compete directly with native workers. For instance, immigrants are found in "immigrant-intensive, fast-growing" occupations such as “food preparation workers” and “building cleaning and pest control workers,” which are crucial to various industry production chains despite requiring minimal formal education (Bahar). This demonstrates the essential nature of immigrant-intensive jobs in supporting and enhancing the job market.

Similarly, the NBER working paper by Mette Foged and Giovanni Peri provides a detailed analysis of the impact of immigrants on native workers using longitudinal data from Denmark. The study, focusing on the influx of non-EU immigrants between 1991 and 2008, reveals that low-skilled immigration had beneficial effects on native workers, particularly those with less education. Native workers experienced increased occupational mobility, moving into more complex and higher-wage jobs as a response to the influx of immigrants. The research underscores a complementary relationship rather than competition, showing that immigrants' engagement in manual-intensive jobs allowed native workers to transition into roles that leveraged their language skills and familiarity with local institutions (Foged & Peri).

These findings align with the Brookings article's observation that immigrant-intensive jobs are not only essential but also growing rapidly. The article notes that "current trends in occupation growth imply that the immigrant workforce will become increasingly central to the U.S. economy," with these roles projected to be among the fastest-growing over the next few years (Bahar). This growth reflects the expanding role of immigrants in the labor market and their contribution to job creation.

The economic benefits of immigrants are further supported by Edwards et al. (2018), who discuss how immigrants contribute to increased output by complementing native workers and prompting businesses to expand. Their findings suggest that "immigration does not coincide with lower native employment rates," and that businesses may use immigrant labor to create more jobs or enhance productivity through better equipment and machinery (Edwards). This perspective is consistent with the NBER study’s findings, which show that immigrants' manual-intensive roles help native workers advance to more communication-intensive and complex jobs, enhancing overall economic productivity and wage levels (Foged & Peri).

However, Cantanzarite (2003) highlights that the influx of immigrants can lead to wage suppression in certain low-status, "brown-collar" occupations. This issue is more about the nature of the jobs rather than immigration itself, suggesting that policy solutions should address these underlying occupational dynamics (Cantanzarite).

In sectors with high immigrant concentration, Peri (2013) explains that immigrants often engage in manual jobs due to language barriers, leading to a reorganization of production that benefits native workers. He notes, "[Immigrants with] limited knowledge of the language, specialize in manual jobs. As a consequence, firms and sectors that hire immigrants generate higher demand for jobs requiring coordination, communication, and interaction — jobs that are typically staffed by natives, whose language skills are superior." By filling roles that natives gradually leave, immigrants contribute to a more efficient labor market, ultimately enhancing productivity and wages for all workers (Peri). This is supported by the NBER study’s findings that immigrants’ manual roles enable native workers to move into higher-skilled positions, promoting occupational upgrading and wage increases (Foged & Peri).

Question for Peers

Given the findings of this study showing positive effects of immigration on native workers' occupational mobility and wages, how might policymakers design immigration policies that maximize these complementary effects while addressing concerns about potential short-term disruptions in specific labor markets?
