Type: Forum

We had to read <a href = "https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2010/0113/My-lender-my-friend-Lending-circles-with-a-Latino-twist">My lender, my friend: Lending circles with a Latino twist</a> and apply the concepts of this week like ethnic enclave, relative deprivation, etc. We also had to discuss whether partnering these traditional lending systems with a bank is beneficial or harmful, using the week's sources to support our points.

<DropDown title = "My Forum 1 Post | Grade: 60/60">

Ethnic enclaves are geographic areas with high ethnic concentration, cultural identity, and economic activity. One example of an ethnic enclave would be the workers in the meatpacking industry in Nebraska, "Meatpacking was often the only employment option with guaranteed hours and benefits for immigrants, particularly females, with limited English proficiency" (Health and Well-Being of Hispanic/Latino Meatpacking Workers in Nebraska.)

In this case, San Francisco's Mission District serves as an ethnic enclave where Latino immigrants live and work, "In some immigrant communities, like San Francisco’s Mission District, it’s a long, uphill climb to gain access to loans with attractive interest rates, which are driven by credit scores" (My lender, my friend: Lending circles with a Latino twist.) 

With the drawbacks come opportunities as well, "The ethnic enclave may, however, create opportunities for all Latin American immigrants, and those immigrants may experience less barriers to attainment than in other labor market contexts" (Latino Communities Emerging Voices, Political, Social, Cultural, and Legal Issues.)

Within these enclaves, traditional lending systems like cestas (or tandas and cundinas) thrive, built on trust and communal relationships.

However, it’s interesting to note that according to Prof. Edna A. Viruell-Fuentes and others “Immigrant Latinos had significantly lower levels of social ties than their US-born counterparts for all the outcomes” (Contextualizing nativity status, Latino social ties, and ethnic enclaves: an examination of the ‘immigrant social ties hypothesis.)

Viruell-Fuentes' words suggest that Immigrant Latinos are not likely to form those communal relationships because of their “lower levels of social ties.” This may hurt their chances of maintaining their relationships with the financial institutions. 

Additionally, “Existing estimates suggest that approximately half of all jobs are found through these informal search processes [networking] (see Corcoran, Datcher, and Duncan 1980), as opposed to formal job search methods such as online or newspaper job listings" (Race and Networks in the Job Search Process.) This is an interesting peice of informaiton because if we understand that most jobs are gained through networking and we take the fact given by Fuentes, that Immigrant Latinos have a “lower level of social ties” then that implies that they too will have more trouble finding jobs therefore needing other ways to ensure a living for their families.

Hence, the partnership between cestas and a bank like OneCaliforniaBank introduces a formal structure for Latinos in contrast to informal financial practices such as networking which they are less likely to be involved with, offering several potential benefits. Firstly, it helps participants build a formal credit history, which is crucial in the U.S. economy. According to the article, nearly half of the households in the Mission District lacked a credit history, which severely limited their access to affordable credit. By linking cestas to credit reporting, participants can improve their credit scores, facilitating access to mainstream financial services and lower interest rates. This aspect directly combats relative deprivation, a concept describing the disadvantage experienced by individuals or groups when compared to the broader society. Here, the relative deprivation faced by Latino immigrants in terms of financial services and credit access is addressed.

Moreover, the inclusion of financial education as part of the MAF program enhances participants' overall financial literacy, improving their ability to manage their finances beyond the cesta contributions. This holistic approach not only strengthens individual economic positions but also has the potential to uplift the broader community economically, fostering a more robust ethnic economy.

However, there are risks involved in this partnership. The primary concerns include the possibility of participants defaulting on their contributions or disappearing with the pooled funds. Although MAF mitigates these risks by guaranteeing to cover any shortfalls, such incidents could undermine trust within the group and the program's sustainability. Despite these risks, the program's early success suggests that the benefits outweigh the potential downsides. For instance, the average credit score increase of 47 points among participants and a 9% rise in satisfactory credit accounts are promising indicators.

Furthermore, this partnership is a strategic move for banks, as highlighted by economist Barbara Robles. By engaging with these nontraditional activities, banks can tap into a previously inaccessible market, cultivating long-term customers who might eventually bring more business as they grow economically.

To conclude, the integration of traditional lending systems with formal banking institutions is largely beneficial. It leverages the trust and communal bonds within ethnic enclaves to promote financial inclusion and economic advancement. While there are inherent risks, the program's design and initial success provide a robust framework for mitigating these challenges. This partnership not only addresses the issue of relative deprivation but also strengthens the ethnic economy, offering a scalable model that could benefit similar communities nationwide.
