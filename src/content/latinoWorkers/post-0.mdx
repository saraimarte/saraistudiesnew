# Sarai's Notes

This is absolutely an easy A class just don't make the mistakes I made....

**1.** Each week the professor posts a list of sources and you will either have to use *all* sources in a forum (discussion post) *or* an essay which she calls writing assignments. 

**Do not make the mistake of thinking that you can use *some* sources and get a 100. You *have* to use all sources posted for that week in order to get full points in both the forums and writing assignments.**

I made that mistake of not using all sources in <a href = "http://localhost:4321/latinoWorkers/spatial-and-skills-mismatch#:~:text=100%20words%20min)-,.,-My%20Forum%203">Week 6/Forum 3</a> because she said the minimum word limit was 200 and I also saw the words "brief summary" so I thought that I didn't have to write much because 200 words is nothing so I figured she wouldn't want all sources to be included but I failed to look at the rubric that said all sources had to be used.  I got 14 points off for that 46/60 (76%).

**2.** Do not make the mistake of copying and pasting her 'citations' (her list of sources each week) as your citations in your writing assignments. I got lazy in the <a href = "http://localhost:4321/latinoWorkers/organizing-latino-workers#:~:text=and%20the%20week%E2%80%99s-,readings,-.">last writing assignment</a> (why sarai why.) I thought it would be okay....no. I got 4 points taken off because they were "incomplete."

**3.** For the group project, my advice is to do that by yourself. If I have the choice, I personally rather have more work to do than risk the quality of my work and my grade with people I don't know. Hence, I chose to do the project by myself and you can see it in <a href = "http://localhost:4321/latinoWorkers/course-project-work-week#:~:text=feature%20in%20powerpoint.-,%22%22%22,Project%20Powerpoint%20and%20Notes%20Document%20%7C%20Grade%3A%20195/195,-Menu">post 7.</a>
