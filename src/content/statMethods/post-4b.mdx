## Hypothesis Test for Mean (σ Uknown)

H<sub>o</sub>: Null Hypothesis - the norm  
H<sub>A</sub>: Alternative Hypothesis - what you want to prove or not

You will need to find 2 things: tStat and P-Value.

tStat = ( x̅ - μ ) / ( s / √n)

P-value = T.DIST.2T( ABS(tStat) , df )

You then want to compare P-value to what we call alpha (α) which will be given to you. If not, the default is α = 0.05.

**Rules:**

P-value < α : Reject H<sub>o</sub>. There **is** significant evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.  
P-value > α : Fail to Reject H<sub>o</sub>. There is **not** significant evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

**1.** A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug and wants to determine if the average recovery time for patients using this drug is **different from** the standard recovery time of 29 days. The company collects a random sample of 25 patients who have used the drug and finds that their mean recovery time is 29.1 days, with a sample standard deviation of 0.217 days. Using a significance level of 0.01, they want to test if there is evidence that the true mean recovery time for patients using the new drug is different from 29 days.

<Solution>

**Answer: P-value: 0.030179 We fail to reject the H<sub>o</sub>**
