## From Discrete to Continuous Data

Discrete Data: Number of Students in the classroom  
Continuous Data: Weight

## Evaluate Normality: Properties of a Normal Distribution

The first property is shape.

A normal distribution is a continuous distribution that has a symetrical shape.

There are continuous distributions that are _not_ symetrically shaped- those are _not_ normal distributions.

For example, below are all continuous distributions.

<ImageMd img={img2} alt = "" />

Notice that every continuous distribution has a curve that follows the data.

Drawing it, helps you see the shape of the distribution better.

Clearly, distribution A is the only one that is symmetrical and therefore we can say that distribution A is a normal distribution or data A is normally distributed while the other distributions are not.

Okay, I know I said that if a cont.dist is symetrical then it's a normal distrution but...that's not always enough to confirm it's truly normal, which is why there are other properties of a normal distribution other than shape we can use to evaluate normality but for some reason the professor does that section _after_ showing you how to find probability using a normal distribution so I guess we'll do the same.

## 2 Types of Normal distributions

There is the standard normal distribution and then any other normal distribution which we call the 'general' normal distribution.

The standard normal distribution has μ = 0 and σ = 1.

A normal distribution that is _not_ standard, has other values for μ and σ.

Despite μ and σ, all normal distributions look the same- symmetrical.

For example,

<ImageMd img={img4} alt = "" />

The first distribution is a standard normal distribution because it has μ = 0 and σ = 1.

The second distribution is a general distribution because it does not have both μ = 0 and σ = 1.

Also Note: When we draw normal distributions you have to use proper notation to let the reader know what μ and σ are.

<ImageMd img={img3} alt = "" />

Basically, we can use these distributions to calculate probability. We will sometimes be given general distributions but we will always convert them into the standard normal distribution.

## Find Probability

Recall: every continuous distribution comes with a curve that follows the data.

With this curve we can find the probability at an exact point (PDF Curve) and up until a certain point (CDF Curve).

Unlike intro to stats for business, we only focus on finding the probability up until a certain point meaning we will only use the CDF curve.

So, let's practice.

**1.** What is the probability that z < 0?

<Solution>

</Solution>

**2.** What is the probability that z < 2?

<Solution>

</Solution>

**3.** What is the probability that z > 2.3 ?

<Solution>

</Solution>
