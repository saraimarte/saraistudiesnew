# The Quadratic Regression Model

We have learned to use the linear regression model but it only works best with _linear_ data. What if we have quadratic data? Then we use the quadratic model.

**1.** The following is the quadratic regression equation for a sample of n = 24.

Ŷ<sub>i</sub> = 4 + 2X<sub>1</sub> + 2.3X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

Predict Y for X<sub>1</sub> = 3.

<Solution>

**Answer: Ŷ = 30.7**

</Solution>

**2.** The following is the quadratic regression equation for a sample of n = 18.

Ŷ<sub>i</sub> = 4496.36 + 63.01X<sub>1</sub> -0.88X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

Predict Y for X<sub>1</sub> = 90.

<Solution>

**Answer: Ŷ = 3039.26**

</Solution>

## Hypothesis Test

If looking at the data is not enough to tell that you should use the quadratic model... you can always test if using the quadratic model sigficantly improves the model/equation.

**1.** The following is the quadratic regression equation for a sample of n = 24.

Ŷ<sub>i</sub> = 4 + 2X<sub>1</sub> + 2.3X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

Suppose that the computed t<sub>STAT</sub> test statistic for the quadratic regression coefficient is 1.95. At the 0.05 level of significance, is there evidence that the quadratic model is better than the linear model?

Yes or no?

<Solution>

**Answer: No, there is not sufficient evidence that the quadratic effect improves the model.**

Sometimes we will have data that is not linear _or_ quadratic so then we can transform some of the data so that it becomes more linear.

# Transformations

Recall that the data we are using needs to satisfy the assumptions: linearity, normality and equal variance.

If either of the last two assumptions are violated then we can transform the **y** values either by doing a log or a square root transformation.

## Logarithm Transformation

## Square Root Transformation
