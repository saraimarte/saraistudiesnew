# Basics 

## Adjusted r<sup>2</sup>

# Residual Plots

Remember if you collect the data over time then you have to do a residual plot also for time. 

# T-Test for Slope

# Confidence Interval 

# Categorical Variables

## 2 Categorical Variables

## More than 2 Categorical Variables

# Interactions 

Happens when the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable changes in response to the value of a second independent variable.
