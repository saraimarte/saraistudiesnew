## Confidence Interval for [anything]

When we work with sampling distributions we end up sampling let's say the mean multiple times so we end up with a whole bunch of means but what's our true mean?

Well, we can use confidence intervals to find the interval where we can be [CL]% confident that our parameter - the true mean- lies within.

CL = Confidence Level (Given)

For example,

**Parameter:** μ - the true mean (the population mean)  
**Point Estimate:** x̅ - the estimated mean (the sample mean)

In this case let's say we want to be 95% confident.

So, in our conclusion we would say,

We are 95% confident that our true mean lies within this interval (lowerBound, upperBound).

But how do we create the interval?

Well, if we're given raw data, there is an excel function that does it for us.  
But if we're given certain components, we will have to construct it ourselves by using point estimate ± sampling error.

## Confidence Interval for the Sample Mean From Raw Data

## Confidence Interval for the Sample Mean (σ Known)

point estimate ± sampling error

x̅ ± critical value (standard error)

x̅ ± zStar(standard error) Note: zStar because σ is known

x̅ ± z<sub>α/2</sub>(σ/√n)

z<sub>α/2</sub> = ABS(NORM.S.INV( α / 2))

α = 1 - (CL/100)

**1.** A sociologist is interested in studying the ages of residents in a particular city. The population standard deviation is known to be 5 years. A random sample of 40 individuals resulted in a mean age of 35 years. What is the upper bound of a 95% confidence interval for the average age? (Round to 1 decimal place)

<Solution>

**Answer: 36.5**

We know we need this: point estimate ± sampling error

n = 40  
x̅ = 35  
σ = 5  
CL (%) = 95

This means that α = 1 - (95/100) = 0.05.

**2.** A nutritionist is interested in studying the daily calorie intake of children in a specific school. The population standard deviation is known to be 200 calories. A random sample of 60 children resulted in a mean daily calorie intake of 1800 calories. What is the lower bound of a 99% confidence interval for the average daily calorie intake? (Round to 1 decimal place)

<Solution>

**Answer: 1733.5**

**3** A financial analyst is interested in studying the monthly savings of employees in a tech company. The population standard deviation is known to be $300. A random sample of 45 employees resulted in a mean monthly savings of $2,500. What is interval of a 90% confidence interval for the average monthly savings? (Round to 1 decimal place)

<Solution>

**Answer: ( 2426.4 , 2573.6 )**

## Confidence Interval for the Sampling Mean (σ Unknown)

Population Standard Deviation σ is not known so we use the sample standard deviation s instead.

point estimate ± sampling error

x̅ ± critical value (standard error)

x̅ ± tStar(standard error) Note: tStar because σ is unknown

x̅ ± t<sub>α/2</sub>(s/√n)

t<sub>α/2</sub> = T.INV.2T( α , df )

df = n - 1

**1.** Given a sample size n = 25, sample mean x̅ = 25, and sample standard deviation s = 10.5, construct a 95% confidence interval estimate for the population mean. (Round to 4 decimal places)

<Solution>

**Answer: ( 67.9658 , 76.6342 )**

</Solution>

**2.** A market researcher is interested in studying the weekly spending habits of customers at a grocery store. A random sample of 31 customers resulted in a mean weekly spending of $250.50, with a sample standard deviation of $45.20. Construct a 95% confidence interval estimate for the average weekly spending of all customers at the grocery store. (Round to 4 decimal places)

<Solution>

**Answer: ( 233.9205 , 267.0795 )**
