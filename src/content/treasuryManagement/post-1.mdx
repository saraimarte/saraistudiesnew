# US Regulations 

In the economy, if there happens to be a crises where the system has failed, the government reacts by pushing out regulations. 

Hence, the government is reactionary not proactive.

The following are examples of regulations passed as a reaction to a certain event or crises. 

**1. 1933 Glass-Steagall Act** 

**Event:** (The Great Depression) Banks were engaging in both commercial banking (taking deposits) and investment banking (trading securities like stocks, bonds etc.) which doesn't sound too bad. The problem was that the banks were using the deposits (which people thought were safe) to trade risky securities. Hence, when the stock market collapsed...the deposits were all gone.     

**Government's Reaction:** 1933 Glass-Steagall Act forced banks to be *only* a commercial bank or an investment bank- not both. This was to prevent the use of people's deposits as funds for securities. 

(Note: This act also passed regulation Q that set a strict limit (ceiling) on the interest rate a bank was allowed to pay you for corporate deposits in order to prevent competition among banks because the government thought that competition between banks wouldn't be good for the economy at the time. 

The ceiling was 5%.)

**2. 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act**

**Event:** (Inflation) In the late 70s, inflation was high which caused money market interest rates to be high as well but because of Regulation Q, banks were capped at paying people only 5% for their deposits.

It didn't matter if the bank wanted to pay people more to get their business; it was illegal.

People stopped putting money in banks because if the market interest rate (the percentage of profit you expect to earn on an investment) was 12% ... and the bank is saying "hey, we will give you 5% profit" ... then it makes sense for people to park their money where they will earn more and that was the money market.  

So people pulled their money from the bank to put it in the money market which drained the banks of the cash they needed to make loans.

**Government's Reaction:** The Depository Institutions Deregulation part of the act removed these interest rate caps and allowed banks to set their own interest rates- this allowed banks to compete with eachother and pay higher rates to attract people's deposits which brought money back to the banking system.   

**Event (Continued):** (Inflation) The FED wanted to control the inflation by limiting the amount of money circulating in the economy and the first step to do that was to find out how much money *was* in the economy. The problem was that they tried to count the money but their data was wrong because a lot of it was float money. 

Float is the ghost money that temporarily appears in two bank accounts at the same time due to the time lag between when a check is deposited and when the funds are actually deducted from the sender. Because banks often give the receiver credit (access to the funds) before the check physically clears the sender's bank, the system accidentally double-counts that money, making the money supply look larger than it actually is.

**Government's Reaction (Continued):** The Monetary Control part of the act aimed to reduce the float by forcing the Federal Reserve to speed up check processing and charging fees for clearing services (the processing and finalizing of the payment.). This decreased the time lag, causing the ghost money to dramatically decrease. With the Float decreased, the Fed finally had more accurate data on the money supply, allowing them to effectively fight inflation.

**3. 1999: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act**

**Event:** In the late 90s, the economy was roaring. Because things were going so well, bankers and politicians began to feel that the old safety rules (like Glass-Steagall) were obsolete and unnecessary. Major companies wanted to merge (specifically Citicorp (a commerical bank) and Travelers Insurance (an investment company)) but legally couldn't under the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act  .

**Government's Reaction:** The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed Glass-Steagall. It allowed for the creation of Financial Holding Companies, meaning that for the first time in 66 years, commercial banking and investment banking were allowed to combine under one roof again. It also established the Fed as the regulator for financial holding companies. 

<hr/>

**4. USA Patriot Act (2001)** 

**Event:** (9/11) The terrorists has used US bank accounts to move money around to fund their attacks, and the banks didn't realize. 

**Government's Reaction:** USA Patriot Act made foreign banks follow U.S bank rules, implemented the "Know Your Customer" (KYC) rule that made banks verify your identity by asking for SSN, address, etc. when you open an account. It also allowed the FBI/CIA access to bank's information to make it easier to track suspicious money.  

<hr/>

**5. Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002** 

**Event:** (Corporate Accounting Scandals) Some companies like Enron were caught in accounting fraud (e.g. lying about how much money they made) to keep their stock prices high. The auditors didn't catch this or looked the other way. When the truth came out, the companies collapsed and investors lost billions of dollars.  

**Government's Reaction:** improved disclosures and financial reporting by developing a code of ethics for senior management, enforcing 8-K forms being released (8-Ks are updates for shareholders between quarterly and annual reports), requiring a financial expert in the audit committee. It also made the CEO and CFOs personally responsible for the accuracy of their financial reports. 

<hr/>

**6. 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act** 

**Event:** (The Great Recession/2008 Financial Crisis) The deregulation from the previous decades turned the market into the Wild West. Banks took massive risks with mortgage-backed securities (MBS), leading to a collapse of the financial system and the housing market. The lack of guardrails allowed the crisis to spiral out of control.

**Government's Reaction:** The Dodd-Frank Act went back to strict regulation like that of 1933 Glass-Steagall Act by empowering regulators to strictly monitor banks for risky behavior that could be bad for the economy and established new protections to shield consumers from predatory financial products (like the bad MBS). It also identified the massive institutions that are so big their failure would destroy the economy and put them under a microscope with tighter rules.

**Note:** The immediate Monetary Reaction by the Fed to the 2008 financial crises was to ease the economy which means putting money into it. How? By buying massive amounts of bonds which injects cash into the banking system.

From now on, I will be listing out the regulations and not mentioning what caused or motivated them.

# Payment Systems Regulations 

**1. Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) 1978:** protects consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers (ATMs, Debit Cards, Direct Deposits, Venmo/Zelle)  by limiting how much money consumers loose if their debit card is stolen, having banks tell disclose fees for using ATMs and provide receipts, and by having banks investigate any errors within a set timeframe.  

**2. Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980** (Mentioned above (2))

**3. E-Sign 2000:** allows you to legally sign documents online, paving the way for fully online banking.

**4. Check 21 2003:** allows banks to process checks electronically without moving the physical check from bank to bank. This further decreases float. 

# Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 

**1. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970** requires the reporting of suspicious transactions and transactions above $10,000.

**2. Money Laundering Control Act (MLCA) of 1986** officially established money laundering as a crime 

# Investment and Securities Regulations

**1. SEC Rule 2A-7** does not permit the MMF(Money Market Fund) to go below $1 NAV (Net Asset Value) in most circumstances. If it remains at $1, that ensures shareholders receive $1 back for every $1 invested. If the NAV goes below $1 we call that **breaking the buck.**  

# Tax Regulations 

**1. Unitary Taxes** Tax on a company's total global profits, not just local earnings.

**2. Foreign Tax Credits** Reduces home country's taxes by the amount paid abroad to avoid double taxation. (E.g. If you make $100 in France but you're based in the U.S., both countries will want a piece of that $100. If France taxes you $20 and U.S. $25 then if you pay $20 to France, the U.S. will say "You owe me $25 but since you paid France $20, you can just pay me the remaining $5.")

**3. Capital Tax** Tax charged on a bank's equity or net worth.

**4. Asset Tax** Tax charged on the total value of assets owned.

**5. Turnover Tax** Tax on total gross revenue (sales) regardless of profit.

**6. Withholding Tax** Tax deducted from a payment before before it is sent to a foreign recipient to ensure they get paid before the money leaves the country.

**7. Sales and Use Taxes** Tax on the purchase or use of goods and services (e.g. taxes you pay when you make a purchase in the grocery store, at the mall, at a restaurant, etc.)

**8. Value-Added Tax** Tax added to a product at every stage where value is added (e.g. Tax is collected in small pieces as a product moves from a farmer to a baker and finally to a store, rather than all at once at the final sale for example.)

# Bankruptcy Regulations 

[More on Bankruptcy Regulations in Chapter 11 and 7]

Bankruptcy occurs when companies are unable to pay their scheduled debt and hence are forced by their creditors to go bankrupt. 

When a company goes bankrupt, there are still bills to pay but there is not enough money and there are a lot of entities you have to pay. 

So who or what gets paid first? 

# Pecking Order 

**1.** Specific Property Pledged 

**2.** Trustee's Costs (a trustee is an entity that takes legal control and distributes assets to creditors and depositors)

**3.** Pre-trustee involuntary liquidation expenses (costs incurred before a trustee was appointed)

**4.** Wages earned three months prior to filing 

**5.** Unpaid benefit contributions (health insurance, etc. ) owed six months prior

**6.** Unsecured claims for customer deposits (money customers paid in advanced for goods or services they never received)

**7.** Taxes due 

**8.** Unfunded pension plan liabilities (they will pay up to 30% of the company's net worth. Anything above that amount is treated as low priority debt.)

**9.** General Unsecured Creditors (like suppliers, contractors, bondholders)

**10.** Preferred Stockholders 

**11.** Common stockholders 

**Goal of Regulation:** To monitor the safety and soundness of the banking system and protect consumers and investors.
