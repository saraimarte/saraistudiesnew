# Insights from Financial Statements 

**1. Overall Liquidity Level:**  (which statements?) 

**2. Ability to generate revenues from assets and control assets** (Balance Sheet and Income Statement -> financial ratios)

**3. Capital structure**

**4. Basis for future expectations of performance**

**5. Consistency and Comparability**  

We have international rules on accounting. 
 
**1. We need things that are relevant to the business**   

**2. Things have to be material (If we are Microsoft we don't care about pennies or $100)**

**3. We need the statements to be faithful (honest)**

**4. We need the statements to be comparable**

**5. We want the transactions in the financial statements to be verified**

**6. Time**

**7. The financial statements should be understandable (In the U.S. we use GAAP)**

**8. They need to be complete.**

**1. Measurements:** Under GAAP we use U.S. dollars.

**2. Revenue Recognition:** GAAP recognizes revenue when earned not received.

# Balance Sheet 


Point: "We don't know- the balance sheet tells you nothing by itself"


When assets go up its a use of cash (e.g. if inventory goes up its a use of cash)
When assets go down its a source (e.g. short term investments going down is a source  of cash. why? bc you sold the investment and got the cash )

Accounts payable went from 1,200,000 to 1,600,000 is it a use or source of cash? (source of cash because you keep your cash instead of spending  it on the asset you got or will get )

When liabilites increase  Source (You kept your cash; "borrowed" from vendor)

When liabilites decrease Use (You used cash to pay off the debt)

(Theyre opposites)
