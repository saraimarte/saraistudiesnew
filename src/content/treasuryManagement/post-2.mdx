# Global Financial Institutions (GFIs)
 
<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **global financial institution** is an entity that provides financial services across multiple countries and regions. 
</RuleBox> 

We will cover three main types of financial institutions along with their functions and services:

**1. Commercial Banks**  (E.g. Bank of America)  
**2. Investment Banks & Brokerage Firms** (E.g. Goldman Sachs)   
**3. Special Financial Institutions**  (E.g. Insurance Companies Pension Funds, Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds)  
 
# KYC Guidelines for GFIs

<RuleBox>
**Fact.** GFIs are required to comply with the 'rules' (financial regulations) of the countries they operate in.
</RuleBox>

For example, a Bank of America in China has to follow the rules of China even though it's headquartered in the US.

Financial regulations may differ in each country but each country follows a common guideline called **KYC.**
  
<RuleBox>
**Def.** **KYC ("Know Your Customer/Client") Guidelines** are a set of requirements that financial institutions must follow to verify the identity of their clients.  This is to prevent money laundering, fraud, and other illegal activities.  
</RuleBox>

The following are the four main components of KYC guidelines:    

**1.** Identify Customer's Identity Using <Pop t ="original documents created by third party unbiased entities with no affiliation to the subject">Independent Source documents</Pop> (e.g passport, driver's license, utility bills)  
**2.** Identify the Customer's <Pop t = "individual or entity who will inherit all your assets if you die">Beneficial Account Owner</Pop>  
**3.** Identify the Purpose and Intent of the Account  
**4.** Perform Ongoing Monitoring of The Account Activity  
 
# Differences in Global vs U.S. Banks 

Below are seven differences between global and U.S. banking:

**1. Global Banks Can Own Non-Financial Corporations but the U.S. Banks Can't**

The U.S. follows the principal of keeping banking separate from commerce. 

In some countries however, banks are allowed to be owners of other corporations (even if they are non-financial like a grocery store or car factory). They can own a small piece (minority) or even enough to run the company (controlling position.) In the U.S., banks are generally prohibited from owning or controlling non-financial businesses like retail stores or factories to ensure they remain neutral lenders.    

**2. The U.S. limit to how much money a bank can lend to a single client is up to 15% of the bank's capital.** Other countries allow up to 25%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

**3. In the U.S., we have thousands of banks.** In other countries, like Canada, they have a few banks (Canada has 5)

**4. In the U.S., we have checking accounts that pay 0% interest,** global banks pay a small interest rate on your 'day to day money.' 

**5. In the U.S., your card gets declined if you run out of funds.** In other countries, your account goes negative which is an automatic overdraft loan that you now have to pay a small interest rate on until you deposit more money.   

**6. Global bank accounts are usually equipped to handle various currency other than just the U.S. dollar and their local currency like pounds, euros, yen, etc.** Most U.S. bank accounts only allow U.S. dollars.

**7. Global banks make it easier for non-residents or people living abroad to open bank accounts.** U.S. banks usually require a social security number and proof of address in the U.S. to open an account.
