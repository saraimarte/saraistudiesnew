# Introduction

Calc 1 Professors usually start with teaching average, estimated instantaneous velocity and exact instantaneous velocity so the first video is a conceptual introduction and the second video will be some examples. Maybe do the problems first in the second video and then watch the first. I'm always a problem first typa girl.

In this video,

 
**1.** To find the estimated instantaneous velocity, we pick a point close to the original point. Note, it can be any point. As for finding the y value for the chosen x point, you don't have to worry about not having a calculator on the exam, they will give you easy numbers if they choose to test you on this.  

 
**2.** To find exact instantaneous velocity, I briefly introduce the use of a limit but don't worry we have a whole lesson on it...it's the next one actually. See you there.
