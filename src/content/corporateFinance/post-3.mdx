# Introduction

The big picture is to look at how the capital structure of a company affects a company's value (V) and cost of capital (R) in two scenarios: (a) a perfect world and (b) a world with taxes.

So, Chapter 16 is split into two parts to cover these different settings but first let's review what capital structure means. 

# 16.1 Capital Structure 

<RuleBox>
**Definition** Capital structure is the mix of debt (D) and equity (E) that a company uses to finance its operations (D/E). 
</RuleBox>

Fact: A company needs money (capital) to operate.

When a company needs money to operate, the process of obtaining and supplying this capital is called financing.

Hence, one of the first tasks a company has to complete is to determine how they will finance their company.

They have two choices: they either use debt or equity. 

For example, you can have 20% of your capital coming from debt and 80% of it coming from equity. 

This ratio (mix) of debt to equity (D/E) is called the capital structure of a company.

Note: What do we mean by "capital coming from debt/equity"?

If you finance your company with debt, that means you're getting capital by borrowing money, often by issuing (selling) bonds.
If you finance your company with equity, that means you're getting capital by selling ownership shares in your company, typically by issuing stocks.

Now, there are three types of companies or three ways a company can be financed:

**Type 1:** They use both debt and equity to finance their company (levered company.)  
**Type 2:** They use only debt to finance their company (levered company.)  
**Type 3:** They use only equity to finance their company (unlevered company.)  

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A levered company is one that uses some debt in it's capital structure. An unlevered company is one that uses no debt in it's capital structure.

AKA Debt = Leverage.

Which is the optimal capital structure? Which type of company is the best?

# 16.2 What is an optimal capital structure?


# A. Capital Structure in a Perfect World

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A perfect world is defined to be one with no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, no transaction costs, perfect competition, firms and investors can borrow/lend at the same rate. 
</RuleBox>

<RuleBox>
**Theorem** The Modigliani & Miller Theorem (MMI) states that in a perfect world, the value of a firm is independent of its capital structure.

AKA: MMI simply says that the capital structure of a company does not affect the value of the company at all.
