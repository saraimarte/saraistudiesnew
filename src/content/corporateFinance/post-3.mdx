# Introduction

The big picture is to look at how the capital structure of a company affects a company's value (V) and cost of capital (R) in two scenarios: (a) a perfect world and (b) a world with taxes.

So, Chapter 16 is split into two parts to cover these different settings but first let's review what capital structure means. 

# 16.1 Capital Structure 

<RuleBox>
**Definition** Capital structure is the mix of debt (D) and equity (E) that a company uses to finance its operations (D/E). 
</RuleBox>

Fact: A company needs money (capital) to operate.

The process of obtaining this capital is called financing.

Hence, one of the first tasks a company has to complete is to determine how they will finance their company.

They have two choices: they either borrow money (use debt) or sell stocks (use equity). 

For example, you can have 20% of your capital coming from debt and 80% of it coming from equity. 

This ratio/mix of debt to equity (D/E) is called the capital structure of a company.

Okay, we established that a company should determine their capital structure but let's propose a question: *How* should a firm go about choosing their capital structure?

Remember, in financial management, the goal was and still is to maximize shareholder value which we will discover-in this lesson- is the same as maximizing the value of the whole company. 

In other words, the company should choose a capital structure where the value of the company is maximized.

# 16.2 What is an optimal capital structure?


# A. Capital Structure in a Perfect World

<RuleBox>
**Definition** A perfect world is defined to be one with no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, no transaction costs, perfect competition, firms and investors can borrow/lend at the same rate. 
</RuleBox>

<RuleBox>
**Theorem** The Modigliani & Miller Theorem (MMI) states that in a perfect world, the value of a firm is independent of its capital structure.

AKA: MMI simply says that the capital structure of a company does not affect the value of the company at all.

Now, there are three types of companies or three ways a company can be financed:

**Type 1:** They use both debt and equity to finance their company (levered company.)  
**Type 2:** They use only debt to finance their company (levered company.)  
**Type 3:** They use only equity to finance their company (unlevered company.)  
</RuleBox> 



<RuleBox>
**Definition** A levered company is one that uses some debt in it's capital structure. An unlevered company is one that uses no debt in it's capital structure.

AKA Debt = Leverage.
