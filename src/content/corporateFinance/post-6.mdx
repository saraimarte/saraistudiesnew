**Problem:** Companies often have more cash than they need-they have to do *something* with it.

Their options?

(1) Keep the cash in the company, or

(2) Return it to investors.

If they decide to give back to investors they have two questions to ask themselves:

**1.** How much should they give vs keep? 

**2.** Should the company pay a dividend or conduct a share repurchase?  

When a company answers these questions, those answers are the **payout policy**.

It's just the approach the firm takes when deciding how much to return to shareholders and in what form.

But before we get into how companies actually decide on a payout policy, we have to ask a bigger question:

**Does it even matter?**

Does it even matter how we give back to our investors? If we pay them with a dividend or by repurchasing shares of stock? 

In other words- can payout policy actually affect the value of the firm, or is it just a matter of preference?

To answer that, we'll start in an idealized, frictionless world- one with no taxes, no transaction costs, and no investor weirdness - just pure theory and what we call the **perfect world.**

# Payout policy in the perfect world 

**Conclusion:** Payout policy in the perfect world does **not** matter.  

## Illustration of how choice of dividends vs. share repurchases does not matter. 

This is where Modigliani and Miller come in.

# Dividend vs Share Repurchase 

# How Much Should be Returned vs Kept? 

by either issuing dividends or repurchasing shares. 

In this chapter, we learn how dividends and repurchasing shares effect the price of a share.
