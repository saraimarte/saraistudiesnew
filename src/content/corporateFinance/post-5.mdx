In this lesson we learn how to value projects or a firm using three methods: (1) APV (2) FTE and (3) WACC.

The value of a firm is the same as the present value of cash flows discounted at the relevant cost of capital. 

But the question is what goes in the numerator vs the denominator? 


# Adjusted Present Value (APV)

# Flows to Equity (FTE)

# Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
