1 means on, true, or somewhere in your circuit is high voltage.   
0 means off, false or somewhere in your circuit is low voltage 

On your laptop, you're pressing keys on and off. 

In circuit, a transistor is a device that's basically switch. 

If voltage is high it turns on and if low it turns off.

You just need three things to build a computer, the OR, AND, NOT gates or just a NAND gate which is all of them in one.
