# 4-Bit Register 


# PC - Program Counter


# RAM - Random Access Memory


When you run a program (even in Python, C, Assembly, etc.), your computer:

Compiles it down into binary machine instructions

Loads those instructions into memory (RAM)

Then the Program Counter (PC) tells the CPU:

“Hey, go look at instruction #0... now #1... now #2...”


Reads instructions from memory (like ADD, SUB)

Pulls values from registers based on those instructions

Performs a calculation using the ALU

Writes the result back to a register
