  pwd on 

you have to look at assembly 
Decipher  not practical 
  objdump -d bomblab

  objdump -d bomblab > bomlab.asm

GDB - new debugger 

gdb bomlab

in  gdb

layout asm to see assembly 
layout reg puts register values on top 

just set breakpoints at functions 

How to go thorugh assembly 

how to go thorugh next insutrction (ni)  just press enter to not write over again 

si to step through a function 

to kill program write kill

good practice to set breakpoints through each function once you encounter them 



manpages on mac and linux 

man fscanf

printing registers 
print $rex 

# 5555 or 7555 its prob a memory address 

to see actual addreess 

print *(int*)$rdi - garbage value

break explode_bomb  run that command so you gaurentee no explosions 

but if you exit the  break points etc. will reset so run  break explode_bomb again 

but if you do it in the beginning it will stay even if you exit 

problem: loops around we have to solve that  

disessmble phase_1 shows you the assembly of phase_1

meltdown lab and in the cave - if you get illegal host error (when you run on your local machine or if you are on a blacklisted ilab)

to run jut put some sort of input RAM
