# Compiling 

The following command compiles your file to a file called a.out by default. We call this an output file.  

<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc file_name.c`}/>

If your file is called 'helloWorld' then it would go like so, 

<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c`}/>

## Flags 

If you want to change the name of the output file from a.out to something new like 'outputFile' then you can run the following, 

<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -o outputFile`}/>

### Enables all warnings 

<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -Wall`}/>

# Treats warnings as errors 
<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -Wall`}/>

# Detects memory issues (AddressSanitizer)
<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -fsanitize=address`}/>

# Combines output, warnings, errors, and memory checks.
<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -Wall`}/>

<Code fileName = "Command" lang = "" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address`}/>

Maximum amount of integers is 2<sup>31</sup> -1. 
So class example: the integers at the end start being negative because it ran out of integers. 

1 byte = 8 bits 
size of shows in bits not byte 

integer division 5/2 ypu get 2 when answer is actually 2.5 you loose info  
so what do you do? Thats where typecasting comes in.

# Signed vs Unsigned 

In a computer there are only positive numbers. 

So how can you represent -5?

Computer will just have a big number.  But how does it know the big number.  

whats the point of unsigned then? if we can just use signed and computer will print out -5. 

with unsigned you can use larger range of numbers.  factorials??

# scanf 

scanf expects an addy of x where the input should go so that is an & 

scanf("%d", x); wrong   
scanf("%d", &x); right   


# Editors 

create file touch pointers.c  or just vim pointers.c

vim pointers.c 

i to edit 

paste code 

esc to get out :w to save  w for write (save) changes to file pointers.c 
:wq to save and exit 

 gcc pointers.c -o pointers -g

 what does g stand for??

 gdb ./pointers

 gdb is a library???

he went over debugging but he went to fast. 


he will give us makefile??

what is makeclean?
