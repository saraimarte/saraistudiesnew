# Conditional Branching 

cmpq and Test Instruction- this is how we compare things in the assembly level


# We want to be able to jump to different types of code 

E.g.

```assembly 
if(address == 127){
    do something}
else{
    do something else}
```


Jump to else from if if if not true.

# From C to Assembly
