# Recitation 1 

**1. Make a CS account**
 
<a href = "https://services.cs.rutgers.edu/accounts/">Make a CS Account</a>

It will allow you to make youre own CS password, 

**2. Use weblogin**

# SSH Another Approach Remote Shell Connectiton 

Open terminal (powershell) Mac and linux have it installed. Sometimes windows doesnt. so just check if ssh works by typing ssh.  

mention password is not visible 

ssh smm651@ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu


ssh smm651@machineyouwanttoconnecto.cs.rutgers.edu

write password 

to exit just write exit. 

"The authenticity of host 'ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu (128.6.13.2)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:BhLuz++ZUJUBUwL0khj9stB0xZtAT1iHpvqfof/HPYU.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? n
Please type 'yes', 'no' or the fingerprint: no

pwd tells you where you are the absolute path 

tab autocompletes

cd with nothing takes you back to the home folder - start again 
cd .. goes back one folder 
cd . same folder 

create file - touch dog.c

if you get permissions denied you did something wrong 

one way is if youre in 

cp doggo.png dogs 

create folder 

move it mv doggo.png folder 

rename file move doggo.png into doge.png

mv doggo.png  doge.png

copy folder (-r) flag 

mv doesnt have r flag needed 

go over copying files and folders 

remove file 
rm dog.c remove files 

remove folder 

not simple as rm folder 
we have to use r 

rm -r animals 

-r for recursive 

i for insert 

escape to go back to n normal mode by clicking esc

go to terminal :term 

ctrl w w twice to switch between terminal and 

scp file.png smm651@ilab1.cs.rutgers.edu ~/Documents 

https://cyberduck.io/

cyberduck allows you to have a fancy file explorer for your machine. it gives you a graphical interface to move files.  

# Writing C 

javac filename  = gcc filename 
bc int main(){
return 0;
}
is type integer we have to return a number 

\n stands for new line 

motivation for f santizie 
make an array size of  5 
if you print array[7] that would not work in java but it would compile in c but with a warning so use 

-fsanitize = address,undefined 

so that when you run the file it tells you that you did something wrong thats overbound 

Questions 
operating system dependent language if you compile code in one machine it wont run in another machine. 


to get out of vim :q!


goo over wall and weror 
cm and rm with -r copying files and folders 
connecting vs code to linux  

sftp


int 4 bytes 
float 5 bytes
double 8 bytes
