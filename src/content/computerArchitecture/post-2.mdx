# Hello World

In every C program, we need a function called **main** that will return an integer. 

That integer will be 0 or 1 and will represent weather the program ran successfully (0) or not(1).  

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "hello.c" code = {
    
`int main(){
    return 0;
}`}/>

Let's say you want to print **Hello World**. 

In C, the command to print is **printf**. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "hello.c" code = {
    
`int main(){
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}`}/>

Now, this by itself won't work because **printf** is a function that comes with stdio.h. 

stdio.h is just a file that contains a collection of input/output functions.

One of the functions is **printf**. 

In order to use **printf**, you need to *include* stdio.h in your program at the top- as a header. 

That's why we call these header files.  

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "hello.c" code = {
    
`#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}`}/>

Now, we're ready to run this! 

But first, like Java, we have to compile the code. 

First, open the terminal in VSCode using CTRL + J. 

## Compiling 

Compiling is just converting human-readable code into machine code (binary, 0's and 1's) that can be read (executed) by a machine. 

In C, the compiler we use is **gcc**. 

Remember, you are supposed to be connected to one of the ilabs while coding in this class. 

All the ilabs are set up the exact same way and have everything you need- including gcc. 

To compile we write **gcc** and then the name of the file we want to compile which in this case is **hello.c**. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc hello.c`}/>

If you simply run this, and **ls** you will see a new file called **a.out**.  

That is the default name of the output file if you don't give it one. 

<ImageMd img = {img2} alt = "Before and after compiling with GCC. You can see that a.out is now created."/>

What the compiler did was compile the **hello.c** code and create what we call an **executable file** that is just the code but in 0's and 1's. 

Now, you may try to fact check me and open up the file using, **vim a.out** and you'll see the following, 

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = ""/>

Then, you may be like "This isn't 0's and 1s!".

It is! It's just that if you open it in a text editor, it tries to display it as characters (ASCII or Unicode), resulting in gibberish like ^?ELF^B^A^A....

Now, let's say I don't want my output file to be called **a.out**. I want to give it it's own name. 

All I have to do is use something called a flag. A flag is just extra specifications you want to add to a command. 

We will use the **-o** flag which allows us to specify the name of the **o**output file. Instead of a.out i'm just going to call it **outputFile**. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc hello.c -o outputFile`}/>

*You can do outputFile.out too. 

Now, if you run **ls**, you will see outputFile as the executable.

Another reason to name your output file is that if you compile without specifying a name, the compiler will default to a.out, overwriting it each time you recompile.

## Running 

Now, run the file like so, 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`./outputFile`}/>
