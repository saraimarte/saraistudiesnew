<Section t= "Hello World Example + Compiling and Running Code Basics">

In every C program, we need a function called **main** that will return an integer. Think of it as boiler plate code- you will almost always need to write it like such. 

The integer returned will either be 0 or 1 and will represent weather the program ran successfully (0) or not(1).  

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "hello.c" code = {
    
`int main(){
    return 0;
}`}/>

Let's say you want to print **Hello World**. 

In C, the command to print is **printf**. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "hello.c" code = {
    
`int main(){
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}`}/>

Now, this by itself won't work because **printf** is a function that comes with stdio.h. 

stdio.h is just a file that contains a collection of input/output functions.

One of the functions is **printf**. 

In order to use **printf**, you need to *include* stdio.h in your program at the top- as a header. 

That's why we call these header files.  

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "hello.c" code = {
    
`#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}`}/>

Now, we're ready to run this! 

But first, like Java, we have to compile the code. 

First, open the terminal in VSCode using CTRL + J. 

## Compiling 

Compiling is just converting human-readable code into machine code (binary, 0's and 1's) that can be read (executed) by a machine. 

In C, the compiler we use is **gcc**. 

Remember, you are supposed to be connected to one of the ilabs while coding in this class. 

All the ilabs are set up the exact same way and have everything you need- including gcc. 

To compile we write **gcc** and then the name of the file we want to compile which in this case is **hello.c**. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc hello.c`}/>

If you simply run this, and **ls** you will see a new file called **a.out**.  

That is the default name of the output file if you don't give it one. 

What the compiler did was compile the **hello.c** code and create what we call an **executable file** that is just the code but in 0's and 1's. 

Now, you may try to fact check me and open up the file using, **vim a.out** and you'll see the following, 

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = ""/>

Then, you may be like "This isn't 0's and 1s!".

It is! It's just that if you open it in a text editor, it tries to display it as characters (ASCII or Unicode), resulting in gibberish like ^?ELF^B^A^A....

Now, let's say I don't want my output file to be called **a.out**. I want to give it it's own name. 

All I have to do is use something called a flag. A flag is just extra specifications you want to add to a command. 

We will use the **-o** flag which allows us to specify the name of the **o**output file. Instead of a.out i'm just going to call it **outputFile**. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc hello.c -o outputFile`}/>

*You can do outputFile.out too. 

Now, if you run **ls**, you will see outputFile as the executable.

Another reason to name your output file is that if you compile without specifying a name, the compiler will default to a.out, overwriting it each time you recompile.

## Running 

Now, run the file like so, 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`./outputFile`}/>

<Section t = "Compiling Code">

The most basic way to compile a file is by using gcc and then the file name.

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc file.c`}/>

We also learned that there are things  called **flags**. They are just extra specifications we can add to commands. 

We already learned how to use one of them, that is the **-o** flag. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc file.c -o outputFileName`}/>

We used it to give the **o**utput file a name but there are even more other flags!
 
Let's say we have a file called **hello.c** and w

**1. -Wall:** Enables all warnings.
<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -o -Wall`}/>

**2. -Wall -Werror:** Treats warnings as errors. 
<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -o -Wall`}/>

**3. -fsanitize=address:** Detects memory issues (AddressSanitizer)
<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -o -Wall`}/>


**4. -Wall -Werror: -fsanitize=address:** Combines output, warnings, errors and memory checks.  
<Code lang = "c" fileName = "terminal" code = {`gcc helloWorld.c -o -Wall`}/>

In Java, memory would see what is not being used up and remove it to save space in C you have to free up memory manually.

# Importing i/o functions 

There already exists functions you can use to input or output data. 

To use these functions we simply have to import the file they are wrriten in.
 
In this case, the file is **stdio.h**. 

The **std** stands for standard and the **io** stands for input/output. 

We call these files header functions hence the **.h** extension in stdio.**h**  

We import the file and any file (as long as it's one that comes with C) using `#include <fileName>`

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "fileName.c" code = {`#include <stdio.h>`}/>

This file includes functions like **printf** and **scanf**. 

The f stands for 'formatted' because for whatever we print or scan- we have to specify the format we want to print or read it in. 
 
# Printing Using Formatting 
For example, let's say I want to print an integer. If we try,

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "fileName.c" code = {`printf(2); //"print this thing"`}/>

That will give us an error saying you're missing format arguments—and you are!

In C, whenever we print something, we must specify the format. Since we're printing an integer in this case, we need to use the integer format specifier: %d.

%d: The "d" stands for "decimal integer," referring to decimal numbers which we’ve used since kindergarten, which represents numbers using digits 0-9, as opposed to binary. 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "fileName.c" code = {`printf("%d", 2);//"print this integer"`}/>

<RuleBox>
Here, are the format specifiers for other data types.  

%d: Integer    
%f: Float     
%c: Character  
%s: String 
</RuleBox>

# Scanning Using Formatting 

<Code lang = "c" fileName = "fileName.c" code = {`scanf("%d", &num)`}></Code>
