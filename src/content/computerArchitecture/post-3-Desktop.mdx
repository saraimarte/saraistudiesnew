All data in computers are represented by 0s and 1s. 

You just need three things to build a computer- the OR, AND, and NOT gates. 

Another option is to use one gate, called the universal gate or the NAND gate.  

A combination of these gates is called a circuit. 

1 means on, true, or somewhere in your circuit is high voltage.   
0 means off, false or somewhere in your circuit is low voltage 

Sometimes you want to know all possible outputs of a circuit depending on whatever your inputs are. 

Two ways to represent the outputs are by a truth table or a formula. 

First, let's focus on what gates are and then we will focus on the rest.

## Simplifying Formulas 

If your goal is to construct a truth table, the method in which you construct a truth table does not change depending on how complex your formula is or not.

However, if you have a complex formula you can still do a truth table but it may take a very long time.

To save time, something you can do is simplify the formula by using boolean algebra.

"Looks like you have connected two terminals together with a wire, delete the and gate correct the wire and add in the and gate again."

Aka you have to find the gate that has a wire that is not connected to anything or is connected to itself or a part of itself and delete it.
