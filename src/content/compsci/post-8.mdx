## If Statements

We are familiar with if statements from pseudocode but how do they look like in Java?

### Example 1| Create a program that displays if an inputted number is even or odd.

Note: We assume this number will be an integer.

Hint: We use our input skills we learned in the last post!

<Code lang="java" fileName = "FileName.java" code={
`  
//take in number from user
int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

//see if number is even
if (number % 2 == 0) {
// if it's even then print out that the number is even
  System.out.println("Number is even!");
} else { //otherwise print out the number is false
  System.out.println("Number is odd!");
}`}/>


Compile and then run with,

<Code lang="" fileName = "terminal" code={`java FileName 4`}/>

the output should be "Number is even!" because 4 is even.

Also, note that we used == instead of = on `(number % 2 == 0)`.

Why? Because == is not the same as =.

We use = to set something equal to something else.

We use == to compare something to something else.

x = y. Here, we are setting x **equal** to y.

x == y. Here we are asking if x **is the same as** y.

(number % 2 = 0). Here, we are **setting** the remainder when the number is divided by 2 equal to 0. Which doesn't make sense because that it not a comparison.

(number % 2 == 0). Here, we are **asking** if the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is the same as 0.

## Nested If Statements

Let's build a calculator that can only multiply or divide two numbers.

The program should take in two numbers from the user and the operation they wish to perform (\* or /).

Hint: To compare a string to another you use .equals() method instead of ==.  
Ex. `operator.equals("*")`


<Code lang="java" fileName = "FileName.java" code={
`  
int num1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); //read in first argument, turn it into an int and store it as num1
int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]); //same thing ^ but for second number

String operation = args[2]; //read in third argument which is already a string

if (operation.equals("*")){ //if user wants to multiply the numbers then...

  int product = num1 * num2; //compute product as the product of the 2 numbers
  System.out.println("Product " + product); //print out the product

} else if (operation.equals("/")){ //if user wants to divide the numbers then...

    //NESTED IF STATEMENT BELOW
    if (num2 == 0){ //first check if 2nd number is 0, if it is then...

      System.out.println("Error: Dividing by 0 is undefined."); //print out an error bc you can't divide by 0

    }else { //otherwise

        int quotient = num1/num2; // compute quotient as the quotient of the 2 numbers
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + Quotient); //print out the quotient

    }

}`}/>

When the user says they want to divide the two numbers- that is a clear example of a nested if statement, because there is an if statement within another.

Why? Because before dividing we had to do an additional check if the second number was 0 because we can't divide by 0.

Otherwise, we can go on to compute the quotient.

## For Loops

### Create a program that prints out all the numbers from 0 to 5.

<Code lang="java" fileName = "FileName.java" code={
`  
for (int count = 0; count < 6; count++) {
  System.out.println(count);
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
`}/>


## While Loops

### Create a program that prints out all the numbers from 0 to 5.

<Code lang="java" fileName = "FileName.java" code={
`  
int count = 0;
while (count < 6 ) {
  System.out.println(count);
  count = count + 1;
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5

`}/>


Notice: we put 6 instead of 5 because remember that we start counting at 0 so we want it to include 5 so we add + 1.
