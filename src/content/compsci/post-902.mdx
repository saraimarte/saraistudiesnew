## Installing the Standard Libraries

Alrighty, so far we have taken inputs and outputs from the command line but there is another way and that is to use the standard libraries!

The idea is that we have a bunch of libraries that each have a bunch of methods we can use. For example, we can use the StdIn library and use it's readInt method to read in an integer and so on.

You can download them <a href = "https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/jj32x6ibxigrxu5yfyhbpu4xxi8n9c20">here</a> if you are a Rutgers student.

If it's not letting you- make sure you sign up for box through <a href = "https://it.rutgers.edu/box/"> here </a>.

Make sure you drop them into the same folder that your file is in.

## Taking in an input

We are used to doing the following,

```java

    int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);


```

We call that the command line method.

But we can also use the standard In library's method called readInt to read in a number given by the user.

```java

    int number = StdIn.readInt();


```

When you run this you might be a bit confused because nothing is happening... but there is something happening. The program is waiting for you to put in a number and click enter.

If you put in 2 and click enter, nothing is happening because you only told it to read the number.

So, use System.out to output the number you just put in.

```java

    int number = StdIn.readInt(); //tell Java to read and store the number

    System.out.println("You entered: " + number); //print out the number


```

If you put 2 again you should get "You entered: 2" back.

Note: the way we use methods is by calling the standard library `StdIn` and telling it which method we want to borrow for a quick second `.readInt()` for example. Methods always end with ().

You can also read in a double, string, or boolean.

```java

    int number = StdIn.readInt();
    double decimal = StdIn.readDouble();
    String stringValue = StdIn.readString();
    boolean stringValue = StdIn.readBoolean();


```

## Providing an Output

We are used to doing the following,

```java

    System.out.println(number);


```

We call that the command line method.

But we can also use the standard Out library's method called println.

```java

    StdOut.println(number);


```

Let's use it in the example above to print out the number we put in.

```java

    // here's a cool thing you can do
    StdOut.println("Enter a number: "); //ask user to put in a number

    int number = StdIn.readInt(); //tell Java to read and store the number

    StdOut.println("The number you put in was " + number); //print the number


```

When you compile and run this it will ask you to put in a number, if you put in 2 and click enter you should get 2 back.

<hr />

## Read in multiple inputs (into an array)

```java

    int[] integers = StdIn.readAllInts(); //read in a bunch of integers and store them in an array called integers
    double[] doubles = StdIn.readAllDoubles();//read in a bunch of doubles and store them in an array called doubles
    String[] strings = StdIn.readAllStrings(); //read in a bunch of strings and store them in an array called strings


```

Let's say you want to take in a bunch of numbers and print out the first of them.

```java

    int[] numbers = StdIn.readAllInts();
    StdOut.println("First Number: " + numbers[0]);


```

When running this line you need to enter the numbers with spaces in between, click enter and then CTRL + Z (Windows) or CTRL + D (Mac) to tell the computer that you are done inputting numbers and then click enter again.

### Example| Write a program that reads in a stream of integers from the user and stores them in an array. Then, print out the sum of all the integers in the array.

```java

    int[] numbers = StdIn.readAllInts(); //reads and stores all numbers

    int sum =  0; //sets sum to 0

    for (int number = 0; number < numbers.length; number++){ //as long as the number exists in the array, add that number to the sum, move on to the next number
        sum = sum + numbers[number];
    }

    StdOut.println(sum); //print out the sum


```

<hr />

## Read in Lines

```java

    String line = StdIn.readLine(); //reads in a whole line
    StdOut.println(line); //prints that line once you click enter.


```

Note: The enter represents the end of your line. As soon as you click enter, this program will print out exactly what you wrote on that line.
