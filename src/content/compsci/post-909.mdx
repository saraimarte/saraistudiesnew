## The Idea

So in the last lessons we have learned how to work with given class API's like String, Picture or Color.

Now we get to create our own.

Let's start by creating a person object.

For this, make sure your file name is Demo.java. Here is what you should start with:

<Code lang="java" fileName="Demo.java" code={
`public class Demo {

    public static void main (String args[]){
        StdOut.println("Hello World");
    }

    //rest of code will go here
}`}/>


If you open the terminal (CTRL + J) in VSCode and run

<Code lang="" fileName="terminal" code={
`javac Demo.java`}/>


click enter and then run

<Code lang="" fileName="terminal" code={
`java Demo`}/>

and enter again, you should see "Hello World" as output.

Note: Make sure you have the StdIn.java and StdOut.java files in the same folder as Demo.java. If not, then StdOut.println() will not work.

Get the files <a href = "https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/jj32x6ibxigrxu5yfyhbpu4xxi8n9c20">here</a> if you're a Rutgers student.

If this does not work then just use regular old System.Out.println();

Okay, everything I write now can be after or before the main method does not matter but it should be still inside the Demo class.

First, if we want to create a person object- we have to create a person class.

<Code lang="java" fileName="fileName.java" code={
`//object = Person

public static class Person {

}`}/>

This says "hey! I want to invent a new data type called Person"

Second, all datatypes or objects have attributes. As a person, you have a name, you have an age, you have an eye color, weight, and even a password to your phone. Those are your attributes.

In Java we call those instance variables.

Here, we will define some of those variables.

<Code lang="java" fileName="fileName.java" code={
`//object = Person
public static class Person {

    //1. attributes of the object
    public String name;
    private int age;

}`}/>


Here, we are saying "hey! make sure that all Persons have attributes of name and age"

Note: there can be public and private attributes- or instance variables.

I'm sure nobody cares who can see their name but maybe some people don't want their age out there so they will like it to be private.

Third, we will set default values for these variables because sometimes people don't want to put in their ages in the first place.

<Code lang="java" fileName="fileName.java" code={
`//object = Person
public static class Person {

    //1. attributes of the object
    public String name;
    private int age;

    //2. defaults
    public Person(){
        name = "defaultName";
        age = 0; // Assuming default age should be 0, not null
    }

}`}/>


Fourth, you want to tell java that how to construct a new instance/version of the person object.

<Code lang="java" fileName="fileName.java" code={
`//object = Person
public static class Person {

    //1. attributes of the object
    public String name;
    private int age;

    //2. defaults
    //this is also called a setter method
    public Person(){
        name = "defaultName";
        age = 0; // Assuming default age should be 0, not null
    }

    //3. tells java how to construct a new person
    //this is called a constructor
    //it should always have the same name as the class
    public Person(String name, int age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

}`}/>


The constructor tells java how to construct or create a new person.
It tells java, "hey! when you want to create a new person- you need to take in their name and age".

What is `this`?

This refers to whatever the new person is.

This is used because when we make a new person we give that person it's own variable name but since we don't know what those variable names will be and each time we create a person the varaible name will be different- we refer to that variable as `this`.

Now, putting it all together, we have:
