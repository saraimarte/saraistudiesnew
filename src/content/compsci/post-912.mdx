import Code from '@components/Code.astro';

There are different types of algorithms we can write to search through or sort an array (or arrayList).

<li style="list-style:none">(1) Linear/Sequential Search</li>
<li style="list-style:none">(2) Binary Search</li>
<li style="list-style:none">(3) Selection Sort</li>
<li style="list-style:none">(4) Insertion Sort</li>

## Sequential Search

When you go through the items in an array or arrayList one by one in sequential order aka just in order.

We will use the following array list of shapes.

```java

    public static void main(String[] args){

        //make array
        String[] shapes = {"Circle", "Square", "Triangle", "Rectangle", "Trapezoid"};

        //convert it into arrayList
        ArrayList <String> shapesList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(shapes));

    }


```

Remember to add these import statments at the top of your file.

```java

    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.Arrays;


```

Let's create a method called 'sequentialSearch' that will search any arrayList for any search term and returns the position of where the search term is in the arrayList.

Call this function like so sequentialSearch(shapesList, "Square"); in your main method and set it equal to int whereOurSearchTermIs. Then output whereOurSearchTermIs.

<summary> Solution (with ArrayList) </summary>

```java

    public static void main(String[] args){

        String[] shapes = {"Circle", "Square", "Triangle", "Rectangle", "Trapezoid"};

        ArrayList <String> shapesList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(shapes));

        int whereOurSearchTermIs = sequentialSearch(shapesList, "Square");

        StdOut.println(whereOurSearchTermIs);

    }

    public static int sequentialSearch(ArrayList <String> arrayListName, String searchTerm){


        for(int i = 0; i < arrayListName.size(); i++){

            //if current item is the same as the searched term then...
            if (arrayListName.get(i).compareTo(searchTerm) == 0 ){
                return i; //return the position where the searchTerm was found
            }

        }

        //after going through all the items return -1
        // b/c the searchterm was not found
        return -1;


    }


    //Output: 1


```

</Solution>

<summary> Solution (with Array) </summary>

```java

    public static void main(String[] args){

        String[] shapes = {"Circle", "Square", "Triangle", "Rectangle", "Trapezoid"};

        int whereOurSearchTermIs = sequentialSearch(shapes, "Square");

        StdOut.println(whereOurSearchTermIs);

    }

    public static int sequentialSearch(String[] arrayName, String searchTerm){


        for(int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++){

            //if current item is the same as the searched Item then...
            if (arrayName[i].compareTo(searchTerm) == 0 ){
                return i; //return the position where the searchTerm was found
            }

        }

        //after going through all the items return -1 b/c the searchterm was not found
        return -1;


    }



```

## Binary Search

We use binary search when the array or array list is sorted by either alphabetical order, numeriacal order, etc.

Has anybody taught you how to play the guessing game the right way?

It's literally binary search.

Let's play a guessing game. Can you find the number i'm thinking about between 0 and 100 using binary search? The only hints you get is if you are higher or lower than the number i'm thinking.

The number i'm thinking is 30 but you don't know that.

Now, let me show you how to play this game.

First, you don't just randomly guess. You always pick the number in the middle.

If your range is from 0 to 100, pick 50 ((0 + 100)/2).

You: 50

Me: Lower

-See, now you got rid of 50 wrong guesses. Now, you know my number has to be less than 50. Now, you repeat the process. Cut the range in half.
Now, your range is between 0 and 50. In the middle is 25.

You: 25

Me: Higher

-Now, you got rid of 25 wrong guesses because you know the number has to be higher than 25.  
-You also know the number has to be lower than 50.  
-Now, your range is (25, 50) 25 + 50 /2 = 37.5 (let's just use 37).
-Now, repeat the process and cut in half.

You: 37

Me: Lower

-Now you know the number has to be between 25 and 27. Repeat the process and pick a number in the middle. (25 + 37 /2 ) = 31

You: 31

Me: Lower

-New Range (25, 31) 25 + 31 /2 = 28

You: 28

Me: Higher

-New Range (28,31) 28 + 31 /2 = 30

You: 30

Me: Correct!

Now, we will do the same thing but in Java.

Let's write a method that takes in an array of integers from 0 to 100 (but not all numbers are there), searches for the number 30 and returns the position of where that number is in the array.
