Recursion: Is just another way of solving problems. It's where one calculation is based of the answer of the previous calculation. This is better shown in action:

Let's say people are in a line and you have to give them each two tickets.

Your boss wants to know how many tickets you gave out at the end of the day.

We can do this with multipliation:

```java

    public static void main (String args[]){

        //read in number of people in the line
        int numOfPeople = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        //give 2 tickets to each person and print out total number of tickets given
        StdOut.println(2 * numOfPeople);
    }


```

We can do this with loops:

```java

    public static void main (String args[]){

        //read in number of people in the line
        int numOfPeople = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        //set count of tickets given to 0
        int countTickets = 0;

        //for every person on the line, give them 2 tickets.
        for (int i = 0; i < numOfPeople; i++){
            countTickets += 2; //keep track of those 2 tickets given by adding it to the count
        }

        //print out the number of tickets given
        StdOut.println(countTickets);

    }


```

We can do this recursively:

```java

    public static void main (String args[]){

        //read in number of people in the line
        int numOfPeople = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        //print out the number of tickets given
        StdOut.println(numOfTickets(numOfPeople));

    }


    //recursive function
    public static int numOfTickets(int numOfPeople){

        if (numOfPeople == 0){ //base case| if number of people are 0 then return 0 tickets.
            return 0;
        } else { //recursive case| if there are still people left, add 2 tickets to the count and call the function again for the next person, so the calculation for the next person is based off the previous calculation.
            return 2 + numOfTickets(numOfPeople-1);
        }

    }


```

See, recursive functions have 2 components- a base case and a recursive case.

The base case is your stopping condition- it will tell the function when to stop calling itself.

The recursive case- returns something and then calls itself again until it reaches the base case.

## Practice

1.You have a fleet of vehicles, and each vehicle has four wheels. Calculate the total number of wheels across all the vehicles recursively.

```java

    public static void main (String args[]){

        //read in number of cars
        int numOfCars = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        //print out total number of wheels
        StdOut.println(numOfWheels(numOfCars));


    }


    public static int numOfWheels(int numOfCars){

        //base case
        //when do you stop counting the number of wheels? when there are no cars

        if (numOfCars == 0){ //when there are no cars
            return 0; //return 0 wheels
        } else {
            //return 4 wheels plus the number of wheels for the next car
            return 4 + numOfWheels(numOfCars-1); //recursive case
            //this return statement is based on it's previous answer
        }

    }

2.You have a group of people, and each person has two hands with five fingers each. Calculate the total number of hands across all the people recursively.

```java

    public static void main (String args[]){

        //read in number of people there are
        int numOfPeople = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        //print out the number of hands
        StdOut.println(numOfHands(numOfPeople));


    }


    public static int numOfHands(int numOfPeople){

        //base case
        //when do you stop counting the number of Hands? When there are no more people.

        if (numOfPeople == 0){ //if no more people
            return 0; // return 0 hands
        } else {
            return 2 + numOfHands(numOfPeople-1);
            //return 2 hands plus the number of hands for the next person
        }


    }

3.Write a function that adds two numbers recursively.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```java

    public static void main (String args[]){

        //read in both numbers
        int num1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);

        //print out the sum of those numbers
        StdOut.println(add(num1, num2));


    }

        //whiteboard: let's say I want to add 2 and 3. We know that 2 + 3 = 5.
        //But how can we break this up into smaller parts?
        //Well, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
        //How do we  translate that into code?

    public static int add(int num1, int num2){ //take in the two numbers, num1 = 2, num2 = 3 num2 is how many times we have to add 1 to 2

        //work backwards. what's the last thing you want to return? It's the last thing in 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 but backwards. (That's 2). So we want to return 2 or num1.
        if (num2 == 0){
            return num1; //last thing we want to return
        }else {
            return add(num1, num2-1) + 1; //for every time we add + 1, well we add + 1 + whatever many + 1 we need to add. How do we know how many +1 we need to do? Well num2 tells us how many. 3!
            //so we need to stop when num2 == 0 when there is no more +1's to add.
        }

    }

4.Write a function that subtracts two numbers recursively.

        //read in both numbers
        int num1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);

        //print out the difference of those numbers
        StdOut.println(subtract(num1, num2));


    }

        //whiteboard: let's say I want to add 5 and 3. We know that 2 + 3 = 5.
        //But how can we break this up into smaller parts?
        //Well, 5 -1 -1 -1  = 2
        //How do we  translate that into code?

    public static int subtract(int num1, int num2){ //take in the two numbers, num1 = 5, num2 = 3 num2 is how many times we have to subtract 1 from num1 (5)

        //work backwards. what's the last thing you want to return? It's the last thing in 5 -1 -1 -1  = 2 but backwards. (That's 5). So we want to return 5 or num1.
        if (num2 == 0){
            return num1; //last thing we want to return
        }else {
            return add(num1, num2-1) + 1; //for every time we subtract 1, well subtract 1 + whatever many - 1 we need to subtract. How do we know how many -1 we need to do? Well num2 tells us how many. 3!
            //so we need to stop when num2 == 0 when there is no more -1's to do.
        }

    }
