## Primitive vs Abstract Data Types

So far we have used primitive data types: int, double, char, boolean

but now we are going to use abstract data types: String, Color, Picture.

Abstract data types are where the client (your computer) can't actually see the representation of your data because it's hidden.

Why is it hidden?

Because anything that is not a primitive type is a reference type.

Meaning that when you create an abstract data type- the computer is creating that object somewhere in the heap. (The heap is just a space in memory where all your objects are stored).

The computer is not able to 'see' the value of the object itself because the <span style = "color:green; font-weight: bold"> variable you set your object equal to </span> only holds the address of where the object is but not the object itself- so the variable _refers_ to the object but again, does not hold the object. Hence, the object is hidden from the computer.

Let's take a look at the String object for example.

We are used to declaring and initializing a string like so,

```java

    String name = "name";


```

but what you didn't know is that this is really called a string literal.

The simple fact is that when a string literal is defined- that automatically creates an object.

Think of the string literal as a short hand to create an object.

This is ONLY true for string literals because the `String` object is built into java and...it's an _abstract_ object.

<details>
  <summary> Why is this only true for objects that are abstract and built into Java? </summary>

    Because integer literals, and double literals, and boolean literals exist aswell but that does not mean they automatically create Integer or Double objects when defined.



    Why?



    Because integers and doubles are not abstract, they are primitive which is why you don't see



    ```java

        Int number = 3;


    ```



    and instead you see



    ```java

        int number = 3;


    ```



    where in the first case, Int has an uppercase I and the second case it doesn't.



    Objects that are abstract start with an Uppercase letter. We have never written Int with uppercase meaning it's not an abstract object, in fact, we know it's a primitive object.



    So despite us defining an integer literal- that does not create an object automatically or at all because int is again, not an abstract object (it doesn't start with uppercase I) - it's not a built in abstract object like String.

</details>

How do I know `String` is an abstract object?

Because it starts with a capital letter.

Have you ever wondered why `String` was the only data type we wrote with an uppercase letter? All the other data types started with lowercase like `int` or `double`.

Again, it's because `String` is the only data type/object that is abstract- the rest are primitive and therefore start with lowercase letters.

Which is why we have been writing this,

```java

    String name = "name"; //upercase string = abstract object


```

and not

```java

    string name = "name"; //lowercase string = not abstract object


```

If we were to have the second case where string is not a built in data type/object then,

1.you would have to create it from scratch or import it as you would Picture and Color (you will learn how to create your own objects in the next lesson)

*which is why I say string literals automatically create string objects only if the object is already built in because you would *have* to create the String object from scratch if it's not already built in and would *have\* to use proper notation to construct that object meaning a literal would not work in the first place.

and 2. you would have to create a String object with the proper notation as you would any other object.

Here is the proper format of constructing a String:

## Constructing a String Object

```java

    String name = new String("name");


```

<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold"> String </span>
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold"> name </span>
<span style="color:black; font-weight: bold"> = </span>
<span style="color:orange; font-weight: bold"> new </span>
<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold"> String( </span>
<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold"> "name" </span>
<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold"> ) </span>

<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold"> Abstract Data Type/Object</span> -
you are telling the computer "hey, I want to create a String"{" "}

<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold"> Reference Variable </span> - this
variable simply just refers to the new object I just created, it is NOT the
object iself. It simply holds the address of the object (the object is in this
place called the heap).{" "}

<span style="color:orange; font-weight: bold"> new</span>- this tells Java to go
and create a new object somewhere in the heap

<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold"> Constructor(</span>
<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold">Data Value</span>
<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">) </span> - this is the way you
create/construct the object- by literally calling the constructor and inputting
the value you want for that object.{" "}

so, we have,

<span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold"> Abstract Data Type/Object </span>
<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold"> Reference Variable </span>
<span style="color:black; font-weight: bold"> = </span>
<span style="color:orange; font-weight: bold"> new </span>
<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold"> Constructor( </span>
<span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold">Data Value</span>
<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">) </span>

## String Methods

Now, objects may or may not have methods we can use specifically for that object only.

In this case, the String object has a whole lot of methods which are pretty cool because they open a whole world of new things we can do.

Note: all methods end with () at the end. Ex. .length()

### 1. String.length()

Outputs how many letters the string contains.

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.length());

    //Output: 4


```

### 2. String.toUpperCase()

Makes all letters in the string uppercase.

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.toUpperCase());

    //Output: NAME


```

### 3. String.toLowercase()

Makes all letters in the string lowercase.

```java

    String name = new String("NaMe");
    StdOut.println(name.toUpperCase());

    //Output: name


```

### 4. String.charAt()

Finds a character at a given index/position.

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.charAt(0)); //outputs the first letter

    //Output: n


```

### 5. String.indexOf()

Finds the index/position of a given character. (Opposite of Method #4)

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.indexOf("n"));

    //Output: 0


```

### 6. String.substring()

Gets a part of the string from a beginning position to an ending position.

Note: It works just like Math.random() where the starting number is included but the last is not.

So if I want to print out the "na" from "name" I can't use (0,1) because it doesn't include the 1st chracter and that is "a", it will only give me the 0th character "n". Instead I have to use (0,2) so it doesn't include the 2nd character "m" but it does include the 1st character "a".

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.substring(0,2));

    //Output: na


```

### 7. String.substring() pt2

You can also use it to find all the characters _starting from_ a given position/index.

```java


    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.substring(1));


    //Output: ame
    //from index 1 = from "a" including a


```

### 8. String.compareTo()

Sees if one string is the same as another.

Returns -1 is they are not the same.

Returns 0 if they are the same.

```java

    String name = new String("sarai");
    String name2 = new String("sara");

    StdOut.println(name.compareTo(name2));

    //Output: -1 b/c sarai is not the same as sara


```

```java

    String name = new String("sarai");
    String name2 = new String("sarai");

    StdOut.println(name.compareTo(name2));

    //Output: 0 b/c sarai is the same as sarai


```

### 9. String.equals()

Sees if one string is equal to another (We use this instead of ==).

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    String name2 = new String("name2");

    StdOut.println(name.equals(name2));

    //Output: false


```

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    String name2 = new String("name");

    StdOut.println(name.equals(name2));

    //Output: true


```

### 10. String.equalsIgnoreCase()

Sees if one string is equal to another ignoring the case.

```java

    String name = new String("name");
    String name2 = new String("name");

    StdOut.println(name.equalsIgnoreCase(name2));

    //Output: true


```

## Practice

**1.** Given any string, output the string backwards.

<details>
  <summary> Solution </summary>

```java


    //Given any string, output the string backwards.

    //read in string
    String word = new String(StdIn.readString());

    StdOut.println("Input: " + word);
    StdOut.print("Output: ");

    //w o r d
    //1 2 3 4  int i = word.length()
    //0 1 2 3  int i = word.length()-1

    //start at the last letter of every word; as long as it exists; run the loop and then move down to the next letter

    for(int i = word.length()-1; i >= 0; i--){

        //print out the letter at specified index
        StdOut.print(word.charAt(i));

    }


```

</details>

**2.** Given any string, write a function that returns the string reversed (Do not display anything/use print)

<details>
  <summary> Solution </summary>

```java

    public static String reverse(String str){

      String reversedString = "";

      for(int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
          reversedString += str.charAt(i);
      }

      return reversedString;
      //this was on my final SP24 and also F23 Section 2 #1 Second Part of the problem
      //https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/fdu42d8mcf32lpchmemhif2bk633jfak
    }


```

</details>

**3.** Given any string, output how frequent a certain character shows up.

<details>
  <summary> Solution </summary>

```java

    //Given any string, output how frequent a certain character shows up.

    //read in word and letter
    String[] inputs = StdIn.readAllStrings();
    String word = new String(inputs[0]);
    String letter = inputs[1];

    StdOut.println("Input: " + word);
    StdOut.print("Frequency of " + letter + ": ");

    //start at the last letter of every word; as long as it exists; run the loop and then move down to the next letter

    int count = 0;
    for(int i = word.length()-1; i >= 0; i--){

        if(word.charAt(i) == letter.charAt(0)){
            count +=1;
        }

    }

    StdOut.print(count);



```
