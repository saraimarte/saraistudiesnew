import Table6 from "@components/tableComponents/Table6.astro";

Data types are types of...well data that we can perform operations on.

There are 5 types of data we will deal with in Java.

<li style="list-style:none"> (1) String (Text 'hello world')</li>
<li style="list-style:none"> (2) Int (Integers 1, 4, -2, -20) </li>
<li style="list-style:none"> (3) Double (Decimals 2.0 2.44) </li>
<li style="list-style:none"> (4) Boolean (True or False) </li>
<li style="list-style:none"> (5) Char (Chracters & or 'B') </li>

## Initializating Data Types

Note: From now on assume that everything I show you is written inside the main method - or the template as I like to call it.

The format for Initializing a variable with a certain data types is

dataType variableName = value;

```java

    String name = "Sarai";  //String
    int age = 102;          //Integer
    double weight = 140.20; //Double
    boolean isHappy = true; //Boolean
    char b = 'b';           //Char

```

## Performing Operations on Data Types

We can perform operations on these data types so let's practice.

Your operators consist of:

<Table6 />

### Example 1 | Initialize two integers, add them together and then display the result.

```java

    int num1 = 20;
    int num2 = 10;

    System.out.println(num1 + num2);

    //30


```

### Example 2 | Initialize two integers, add them together and then display the result.

```java

    String name = "Sarai";
    String college = "Rutgers";
    int age = 103;

    System.out.println("My name is " + name + ". I go to " + college + " and I am " + age + " years old.");

```

### Example 3 |

### Example 4 | Initialize two doubles, subtract the second double from the other and then display the result.

```java

    double num1 = 20;
    double num2 = 10;

    System.out.println(num2 - num1);

    //10


```

### Example 5 | What does this statement evaluate to?

```java

    System.out.println(2 + 4 + "3");

    // 63


```

### Example 6 | What does this statement evaluate to?

```java

    System.out.println(2 + "4" + 3);

    // 243


```

### Example 7| What does this statement evaluate to?

```java

    System.out.println("4" + 2 + 3);

    // 423

    //Why not 45? Because we only add the integers next to eachother if they are before a character. Here, they are after the character. (Charcter or string?)


```

### Example 8 | What does this statement evaluate to?

```java

    String number = "String";
    System.out.println(number);

    // "String"


```

### Example 9 | What does this statement evaluate to?

```java

    boolean x = true;
    boolean y = true;

    System.out.println( (x && !y) || (x && y) );

    //true


```

### Example 10 | What does this statement evaluate to?

```java

    boolean x = true;
    boolean y = true;

    System.out.println( (true) || (1 > 5) );

    //true


```

<hr />

## Casting

Casting is all about changing a _numerical_ data type to another (so it doesn't work with strings bc a string is not numerical).

### Example 1| Integer to a Double

```java

    int num1 = 20;

    double num2 = (double) num1;

    System.out.println(num2);

    // 20.0


```

### Example 2| Double to an Integer

```java

    double weight = 140.20;

    //here the (int) turns the age which is a double into an integer
    int weightAsAnInteger = (int) weight;

    System.out.println(weightAsAnInteger);

    // 140
    //Notice how it rounded down.
    //(int) will always round down even if the double is 140.90


```

But what if we do want to turn a string into an integer?

We can use what are called the system's version of casting or the systems method which use parsing.

### Example 3| String to an Integer

```java

    String ageAsString = "103"; //String

    int ageAsInteger = Integer.parseInt(ageAsString); // Turning String into Integer

    System.out.println(ageAsInteger);

    //103


```
