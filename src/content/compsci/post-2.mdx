Alright! Counting Operations is a skill. To master it- you need to practice.

Note: Refer to the Counting Operations section on the <a href = "https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/6saf32ambqftpwlnp3hds9z86i0yce2e">pseudocode reference sheet</a>


## Example 1

This program takes in two numbers and returns their sum.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 1" code={`READ num1
READ num2

COMPUTE sum AS num1 + num2

DISPLAY sum`} />

Maximum Operations: \_\_\_\_

## Example 2

This program determines if a number is even or odd.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 2" code={`READ number

IF number % 2 == 0 THEN
    DISPLAY even
ELSE
    DISPLAY odd
ENDIF`} />

## Example 3

This program calculates the area of a rectangle.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 3" code={`READ base
READ height

IF base < 0 OR height < 0 THEN
    DISPLAY ERROR
ELSE
    COMPUTE area AS base * height
    DISPLAY area
ENDIF`} />

## Example 4

This program calculates the total cost a customer will pay, factoring in a $10 discount coupon if their purchase amount exceeds $100; otherwise, it provides the original purchase amount.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 4" code={`READ purchaseAmount

SET couponAmount TO 10

IF purchaseAmount > 100 THEN
    COMPUTE totalCost AS purchaseAmount - couponAmount
ELSE
    SET totalCost TO purchaseAmount
ENDIF

DISPLAY totalCost`} />

## Example 5

This program prints the numbers 1 to 5.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 5" code={`SET i TO 1

WHILE i <= 5
    DISPLAY i
    INCREMENT i BY 1
ENDWHILE`} />

## Example 6

This program tells you when a rocket has launched.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 6" code={`READ initialCountdown

SET countdown TO initialCountdown

WHILE countdown > 0
    DISPLAY "Countdown: " + countdown
    COMPUTE countdown AS countdown - 1
ENDWHILE

DISPLAY "Rocket Launched!"`} />

## Example 7

This program helps a college student count down the days until the next break, updating them on the days left every morning.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 7" code={`READ daysUntilBreak

WHILE daysUntilBreak > 0
    DISPLAY "Days until break: " + daysUntilBreak
    COMPUTE daysUntilBreak AS daysUntilBreak - 1
ENDWHILE

DISPLAY "Break time! Enjoy your break!"`} />

## Example 8

This program calculates a student's letter grade by considering both exam score and participation points. It validates the input and assigns a letter grade based on specific conditions, ensuring accurate grading.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 8" code={`READ examScore
READ participationPoints

IF examScore < 0 OR examScore > 100 OR participationPoints < 0 OR participationPoints > 10 THEN
  DISPLAY Please enter valid scores.
ELSE
  IF examScore >= 90 AND participationPoints >= 5 THEN
    SET letterGrade TO "A"
  ELSE IF examScore >= 80 AND participationPoints >= 3 THEN
    SET letterGrade TO "B"
  ELSE IF examScore >= 70 AND participationPoints >= 2 THEN
    SET letterGrade TO "C"
  ELSE
    SET letterGrade TO "F"
  ENDIF
  DISPLAY "Letter Grade: " + letterGrade
ENDIF`} />

## Example 9

This program keeps track of a cleaner's money earned. The money they earn depends on each task they complete.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 9" code={`SET moneyEarned TO 0

READ cleanRoom
READ washDishes
READ takeOutTrash
READ cleanBathroom
READ vacuumFloor

IF cleanRoom IS true THEN
    ADD 20 TO moneyEarned
ENDIF

IF washDishes IS true THEN
    ADD 15 TO moneyEarned
ENDIF

IF takeOutTrash IS true THEN
    ADD 5 TO moneyEarned
ENDIF

IF cleanBathroom IS true THEN
    ADD 30 TO moneyEarned
ENDIF

IF vacuumFloor IS true THEN
    ADD 20 TO moneyEarned
ENDIF`} />

## Example 10

This program calculates the total cost of purchasing items from a grocery store, with predefined prices for each item. Assuming all inputs are positive integers including 0.

<Code lang="java" fileName="Example 10" code={`SET totalCost TO 0

READ applesQuantity
READ bananasQuantity
READ orangesQuantity
READ tomatoesQuantity
READ cucumbersQuantity

IF applesQuantity > 0 THEN
    ADD 2 * applesQuantity TO totalCost
ENDIF

IF bananasQuantity > 0 THEN
    ADD 1.5 * bananasQuantity TO totalCost
ENDIF

IF orangesQuantity > 0 THEN
    ADD 2.5 * orangesQuantity TO totalCost
ENDIF

IF tomatoesQuantity > 0 THEN
    ADD 3 * tomatoesQuantity TO totalCost
ENDIF

IF cucumbersQuantity > 0 THEN
    ADD 1 * cucumbersQuantity TO totalCost
ENDIF

DISPLAY totalCost`} />
