## What we know:

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "What we know" code = {`int[] arr = new int[2];`}/>

This gives us an array with 2 integers, with 0's by default: [0,0]

## What's new:

<Code lang="java" fileName="What's new" code={`int[][] arr = new int[2][2]; //[row][cols]`} />

This gives us an array with 2 rows and 2 columns filled with integers (0's by default):

[0,0]  
[0,0]

## Another way to look at this:

## What we know:

<Code lang="java" fileName="What we know" code={`int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};`} />

This gives us: [1, 2, 3, 4]

## What's new:

<Code lang="java" fileName="What's new" code={`int[][] arr = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} }; //row 1  //row2`} />

This gives us:  
[1, 2]  
[3, 4]

Here, you can see what a 2D array is.

It's literally an an array of arrays.

You have an two arrays within one array. Those two arrays, you can visualize them stacked on top up of one another with each array being a row.

## Getting Info from the array

Let's start by printing out the values in the array like how we have them visualized.

<Code lang="java" fileName="What we know" code={`
int[][] numbers = new int[2][2];

for (int row = 0; row < numbers.length; row++) {
    StdOut.println(" "); // add an 'enter'/space after each row
    for (int column = 0; column < numbers.length; column++) {
        // print out the value and a space after
        System.out.print(numbers[row][column] + " ");
    }
}

// Output:
// [0  0]
// [0  0]
`} />

## How many rows are there? Columns?

Let's take this array:

<Code lang="java" fileName="What we know" code={`int[][] arr = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};`} />

How many rows are there?

<Code lang="java" fileName="What we know" code={`arr.length; //2`} />

How many columns are there?

<Code lang="java" fileName="What we know" code={`arr[0].length; //3`} />

Above, you can take any row since all rows have the same amount of columns, and see how how long it is, aka count the columns. We took the first row (index 0) and found it's length.

## Practice:

**1.** Given a 2D integer array, change all the negative numbers to zero.

<Solution>
<Code lang="java" fileName="Problem 1" code={`
public class fileName {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[][] arr = new int[2][2];
        arr[0][0] = 1;
        arr[0][1] = -2;
        arr[1][0] = -3;
        arr[1][1] = 4;

        for (int row = 0; row < arr.length; row++) { // go through each row
            for (int col = 0; col < arr.length; col++) { // go through each column
                if (arr[row][col] < 0) { // if number is negative
                    arr[row][col] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        // check your work
        for (int row = 0; row < arr.length; row++) { // go through each row
            for (int col = 0; col < arr.length; col++) { // go through each column
                StdOut.println(arr[row][col]);
            }
        }
    }

}
`} />


</Solution>
