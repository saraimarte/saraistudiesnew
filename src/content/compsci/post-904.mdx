You have a body.

Your body functions.

Meaning it takes actions.

What are some functions that your body takes?

Well, your body speaks.

So, we can think of speaking as a function of your body.

You start with thinking about what you want to say, you subconsciously tell your mind that you want to say it so then your body functions and outputs what you wanted to say.

The average person however doesn't know how many neurons are needed to be connected or whatever else needed to happen in order for that thought to be converted into spoken words but we don't care.

All we care about is that if we input a thought, our body functions, and speaks that thought. We don't care what happens in between or how our body converted that thought into spoken words.

Similarly, in programming, functions are pre-written pieces of code that take in inputs (or no inputs) and then provide 0 or only one output.

We have already used many functions. For example:

**(1) Math.pow()** is a function we've used.

We put in two inputs (number, what we want the number to be raised to) and get an output.

Ex. Math.pow(2, 3) is the same as 2^3 = 8

We didn't have any idea what went on inside or how it converted the two inputs into the output, we just cared that it did it's job- which was to function (pun was intended).

It's **function** was to input two numbers and output another number.

**(2) Math.random().**

This is an example of a function we have used that does not take an input but provides 1 output.

By default, the code in this function - which we can't see- generates random numbers between 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive.

So there was no input but we knew that the output would be a number between [0, 1).

It's only **function** was to output a number.

**(3) StdIn.readInt().**

This function we know takes in an integer as input, but it never outputs anything.

It's only **function** was to read in an integer.

**(4) main()**

This function took in an array called args- short for arguments- that could only take in Strings as input.

Which is why we wrote

`main (String[] args);`

However, it never provided any output.

It's only **function** was to read in arguments.

Note: Functions and Methods are the same thing in Java.

So, how do we write a function?

<hr />

### How to write a function

```java

    public static returnType nameOfFunction (dataTypeOfInput1 input1, dataTypeOfInput2 input2) {
        code goes here
        return whatever youre returning
    }


```

public - everyone can acess it as opposed to a private function

static - we will use static for now in all our functions

returnType - this will always be the type of the data your function will return.

nameOfFunction - self explanatory

return - whatever youre returning (what you want your output to be)

### Example 1 | Write a function that takes in two integers and returns their sum (2 Inputs; 1 Output.)

```java

    public static int sum (int num1, int num2) {
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        return sum;
    }


```

Okay, you wrote the function but you haven't called it yet.

### How and Where do you call a function?

You call your function within the main function since that is where we write all our code in Java.

The function itself should be outside of the main function but within the class.

However, it does not matter if it's placed before or after the main function- the main function will always run first.

Here is how the function is placed.

```java

    public class fileName {

        //main function starts
        public static void main (String[] args){
            //call the function here and input your arguments
            sum(2,2);
        }
        //main function ends

        //notice how this function is outside of the main function but still within the class
        public static int sum (int num1, int num2) {
            int sum = num1 + num2;
            return sum;
        }

    }


```

Great! But if you compile and run nothing happens. Why? Well, your function is running. Java is adding 2 + 2 but you don't see the result because you never asked for it.

So, print out the sum.

```java

    public static void main (String[] args){
        //print out the output of your function
        StdOut.println(sum(2,2));
    }

```

and you should get 4 in the terminal!

Now, this was a function that took in two inputs (two integers) and returned one output (their sum).

Let's write a function that takes in 1 input and returns 1 output.

### Example 2| Write a function that takes your age and returns how old you will be in 54 years (1 Input; 1 Output.)

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){

            //print out how old I will be in 54 years.
            StdOut.println("You will be " + ageCalculator(20) + " in 54 years.");

        }

        public static int ageCalculator (int age){
            //compute newAge as my current age + 54 years
            int newAge = age + 54;

            return newAge;
        }

    }

    //omg i'll be 74


```

If you compile and run you should get 74 (if you put 20 as your argument).

Now, instead of manually putting in the argument within the code, you also can ask the user for their age directly- which we know how to do already.

We can use our command line methods like Integer.parseInt() or we can use our standard library method like StdIn.readInt().

Let's use the libraries to practice.

### Example 3| Write a function that takes your age (not as an argument) and returns how old you will be in 54 years (0 Inputs; 1 Output.)

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){

            //print out how old I will be in 54 years.
            StdOut.println("You will be " + ageCalculator() + " in 54 years.");

        }

        public static int ageCalculator (){

            StdOut.println("Enter your age: "); //prompt user for their age
            int age = StdIn.readInt(); //this will wait for the user to enter their age
            int newAge = age + 54; //compute newAge as user's age + 54 years
            return newAge; //returns the new age

        }

    }


```

Hopefully, this specific problem establishes the fact what we mean by inputs- anything that goes within the parentheses when you call a function. If nothing goes in there, then there is no input. Even though technically we are asking for the user's age- we are not requesting it as a required input within the parentheses.

### Example 4| Write a function that displays your age (1 input; 0 outputs).

In the previous code we can replace this

```java

    StdOut.println("You will be " + ageCalculator() + " in 54 years.");


```

with a function since we might need to display our newAge more times and we don't want to keep re-writing that same line.

```java

    public static void displayAgeIn54Years(int age) {
        StdOut.println(age);
    }


```

Here, is the completed code,

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){

            int newAge = ageCalculator(); //get the newAge
            displayAgeIn54Years(newAge); //display the newAge

        }

        public static int ageCalculator (){

            StdOut.println("Enter your age: "); //prompt user for their age
            int age = StdIn.readInt(); //this will wait for the user to enter their age
            int newAge = age + 54; //compute newAge as user's age + 54 years
            return newAge; //returns the new age

        }

        public static void displayAgeIn54Years(int age) { //NOTE: Functions where we return nothing have a returnType of void because we are literally returning the void- nothing. darkness. nada.
            StdOut.println(age);
        }
    }


```

Hopefully, this specific problem establishes the fact what we mean by outputs- anything that we are returning. If we are not returning anything then there is no output.

Okay, let's practice!

<hr />

### Problem 1| Write a function that takes in two doubles as arguments and returns their difference. Display the difference. How many inputs and outputs does this function require?

Assume the first number is always bigger than the second number.

Inputs: 2 doubles  
Outputs: 1 (the difference)

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){
            StdOut.print(difference(10.5,5.2));
        }

        public static double difference (double num1, double num2){
            double difference = num1 - num2;
            return difference;
        }

    }

    //Output: 5.3


```

### Problem 2| Write the same function as above but without taking the two doubles as arguments. How many inputs and outputs does this function require?

Inputs: 0  
Outputs: 1 (the difference)

The only difference here is that we program the function to take in the two doubles from the user in the terminal instead of having the two numbers being taken as arguments.

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){
            StdOut.print(difference());
        }

        public static double difference (){
            StdOut.print("Enter 2 decimals (When done click enter and then CTRL + Z for WIN CTRL+D for MAC): ");
            double[] numbers = StdIn.readAllDoubles(); //read in all doubles
            double difference = numbers[0] - numbers[1]; //compute the difference as the difference between the first number (0) and the second number (1)
            return difference;
        }

    }

    //Output: 5.3


```

Because we're taking more than one number from the user we can't use .readDouble() to read in both of them at the same time. To do that, we can to use .readAllDoubles() which means we have to store all those doubles into an array- I called the array numbers.

(We could have used .readDouble() to read the number and store them one at a time. See Problem 4.)

Now, because the numbers are in an array, we had to access them by indexing the array.

The index of the first number in the array is 0 and the index of the second number is 1.

### Problem 3| Write a function that takes in two names as arguments and _only_ displays those names together with a heart in between. How many inputs and outputs does this function require?

Here, copy this heart `<3` .

Example Output: "Sarai `<3` God"

Inputs: 2 (strings)  
Outputs: 0

````java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){
            loveMessage("Sarai", "God");
        }

        public static void loveMessage (String name1, String name2){
            StdOut.print(name1 + " <3 " + name2);
        }

    }

    //Output: "Sarai ```<3``` God"


````

### Problem 4| Write the same function that takes in two names but NOT as arguments. How many inputs and outputs does this function require now?

Inputs: 0  
Outputs: 0

````java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){
            loveMessage(); //call the function
        }

        public static void loveMessage (){ //note: there are no arguments within the parentheses in loveMessage() hence no inputs.

            StdOut.print("Enter name1: "); //ask user to enter first name
            String name1 = StdIn.readString(); //read and store the first name

            StdOut.print("Enter name2: "); //ask user to enter second name
            String name2 = StdIn.readString(); //read and store the second name

            StdOut.print(name1 + " <3 " + name2); //notice we are not returning anything hence the void returnType in the signature of the function
        }

    }

    //Output: "Sarai ```<3``` God"


````

Here, instead of using .readAllStrings() I read each name one at a time. I prompted the user for the first name and then waited, got it, stored it. Same for the second.

(I could have also put them all in at one go with .readAllStrings() , click enter, ctrl + z and then have them stored in an array but this works too.)

### Problem 5| Write a function that returns the area of a triangle. Formula: (1/2) base \* height. How many inputs and outputs does this function require?

Inputs: 2 (base and height)  
Outputs: 1 (area)

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void main (String[] args){
            double area = triangleArea(10,5);
            StdOut.print(area); //print the returning value of the function - that is the area
        }

        public static double triangleArea (double base, double height){

            double area = ((double)1/2) * base * height;
            return area;

        }
    }


```

Here, we had to cast the (1/2) to a double because the 1 and 2 are integers. Remember, that our return type is double hence everything has to be a double.
