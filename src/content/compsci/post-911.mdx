This lesson is all about analyzing the performance of your code based on how much input goes into your code.

We measure performance by measuring efficiency.

Efficiency is a measure of speed and space consumption aka how long something takes to run and how much space it needs to run aka the big O.

Finding the Big O is really just counting operations except you only care about what is signficant as n gets really big aka we don't count constants.

Big(O) is also the worst case of performace.

It's the worst possible time and space a program can take.
