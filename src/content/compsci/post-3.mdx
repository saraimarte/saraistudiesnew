# The Template

For now, in Java, we write everything inside what I like to call the 'template.' 

<Code lang="java" fileName="FileName.java" code={`public class FileName {

    public static void Main (String[] args){
        everything
    }
}`} />

I call it the 'template' because we start with this piece of code in *all* of the programs we will ever write in Java.

Inside the template we have the (1) FileName class and the (2) Main method. 

For now, think about them like this...

(1) think about the FileName class as telling Java "Hey, I want to write some code for this file called [insert fileName]"

(2) think about the Main method as telling Java "Hey, anything I write inside the curly brackets is the code I want this file to run."

<DropDown title = "Tip">
The way I memorized the template is by taking 5 minutes and attempting to do it. I would forget the first few times, I would take a peak and then start from scratch again until I could write the whole thing from memory. Then, to have it stay in your memory, write it from scratch every time you start a new java file instead of copying and pasting.

## Print Statements

Let's write our first program! Print "Hello World!" in a java file called HelloWorld.

<Code lang="java" fileName="HelloWorld.java" code={`public class HelloWorld {

    public static void Main (String[] args){

        System.out.println("Hello World!");

    }
}`} />

This can be read as we are contacting the **system** (think of it as the computer) and we want it to **print** **out** **"Hello World!"**.

The print**ln** stands for print **line**, meaning whatever is being printed will be printed in a new line.
You could have also done:

<Code lang="java" fileName="HelloWorld.java" code={`System.out.print("Hello World!");`} />

and that would just print "Hello World!" on the same line as anything else you would have printed before.

Here, there is no difference because we're only printing one thing, but if we had more things to print, we wouldn't want them to be all printed in one line but in different ones, so we use `println`.

Okay, but you wrote it but nothing is happening. Why? Because you haven't run it.

It's like you thinking you want to say Hello to a person but not actually speaking it. You have to run your mouth to say something, no?

What's the equivalent of running your mouth in Java? Literally running your code.

## Compiling and Running

Before running, we have to compile our code in our terminal.

Terminal: Click on CTRL + J or CMD + J to open it in VSCode.

Think of compiling as preparing your code to be ran. All you have to do to compile your code is,

<Code lang="" fileName="terminal" code={`javac HelloWorld.java`} />

java**c** -> the c stands for compile

Then, to run the code, write,

<Code lang="" fileName="terminal" code={`java HelloWorld`} />

Great! Now you should see your Hello World printed in the terminal!
