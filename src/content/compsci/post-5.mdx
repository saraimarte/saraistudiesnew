## Math Library

### Introduction

Have you ever asked yourself how to square a number in java?

Well, you can multiply it by itself...

```java

   System.out.println(4*4); //same thing as 4^2 = 16


```

but what if you want to cube a number?

Well, you can multiply it by itself 3 times...

```java

   System.out.println(4*4*4); //same thing as 4^3 = 64


```

But what if you want to raise a number to the 12th power?

Will you multiply that number by itself 12 times?

```java

   System.out.println(4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4); //same thing as 4^12 = 16777216


```

...yeah no. We don't have all day.

That's why the math library exists!

The library comes with a bunch of pre built functions/methods you can use like the pow function (stands for power).

So, using the power function from the Math library...

```java

   System.out.println(Math.pow(4, 12)); //same thing as 4^12 = 16777216 but much nicer :)


```

Note: I'm putting all these Math.methodName()'s inside System.out.println() method so you can copy and paste into your own file and see the result printed for yourself :)

## Math.pow()

Raises the first input to the power of the second input.

Works with Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.pow(5, 2)); //5^2 = 25.0


```

Works with Negative Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.pow(-5, 3)); //-5^3 = 125.0


```

Works with Doubles

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.pow(2.4,2)); //5.76


```

Note: The Math.pow method returns only doubles no matter what you put in.

## Math.min()

Finds the lowest value out of the two inputs.

Works with Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.min(1,2)); //1


```

Works with Doubles

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.min(1.2,2.4)); //1.2


```

## Math.max()

Finds the greatest value out of the two inputs.

Works with Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.max(1,2)); //2


```

Works with Doubles

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.max(1.2,2.4)); //2.4


```

## Math.abs()

Takes absolute value of input.

Works with Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.abs(-1)); //1


```

Works with Doubles

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.max(-1.2)); //1.2

```

## Math.sqrt()

Squares input.

Works with Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.sqrt(4)); //2.0


```

Does not work with negative Integers

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.sqrt(-4)); //NaN


```

Works with Doubles

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.sqrt(5.76)); //2.4


```

Note: Always returns doubles no matter what you put in.

## Math.ceil()

Rounds whatever you give it to the next whole number (it just rounds up).

20.9 -> 21

20.2 -> 21

21 -> 21 (so, there is really no point in providing ints as input for ceil since it will give you the same thing you gave it.)

Note: Always returns doubles no matter what you put in.

Works with Integers (no point in this)

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.ceil(21)); //21


```

Works with Doubles Ex1

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.ceil(20.9)); //21


```

Works with Doubles Ex2

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.ceil(20.2)); //21


```

## Math.floor()

Opposite of ceil(). This rounds down- to the FLOOR. Down. Floor. See the connection?

Note: Always returns doubles no matter what you put in.

Works with Integers (no point in this)

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.ceil(20)); //20


```

Works with Doubles Ex1

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.floor(20.2)); //20.0


```

Works with Doubles Ex2

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.floor(20.9)); //20.0


```

## Math.PI

Math.PI gives you &#120645;

```java

   StdOut.println(Math.PI); //3.141592653589793


```

### Math.random()

About:

<li style="list-style:none"> (1) Generates a random **double** from 0 to 1.</li>
<li style="list-style:none"> (2) It always includes the first number. </li>
<li style="list-style:none">
  {" "}
  (3) It does not include the last number unless you add a +1.
</li>
<li style="list-style:none">
  {" "}
  (4) If you want it to be a number greater than 0 to 1 then just multiply by
  the last number.{" "}
</li>
<li style="list-style:none">
  {" "}
  (5) Inclusive = number should be included. Exclusive = number should be
  excluded.{" "}
</li>

### Example 1 | Generate a random _integer_ between 0 and 1 not including 1

```java

   int randomNum = (int) Math.random()
   System.out.println(randomNum);


```

### Example 2 | Generate random _integer_ between 1 and 10 (both inclusive)

```java

   int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 10 + 1);
   // OR int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 11);

   System.out.println(randomNum);


```

### Example 3 | Generate random _integer_ between 0 and 5 (not including 5)

```java

   int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 5 );
   System.out.println(randomNum);


```

## Conclusion

Only Math.pow(), Math.sqrt(), Math.ceil() and Math.floor() return _only_ doubles. As in no matter what you put in- in an integer or double- you will _only_ get a double back.

Honestly, these are not too hard to remember but if this is what you're missing to study and your exam is in five minutes- do not bother memorizing these because these are on the cheat sheet they provide for you (they even include examples).
