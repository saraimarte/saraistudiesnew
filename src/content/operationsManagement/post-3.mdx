# Example 1

DenimWorks Factory produces shirts and pants using two resources: yards of denim and labor hours.

The factory has a maximum of 90 yards of denim and 40 labor hours available each day.

Each shirt requires 3 yards of denim and 1 hour of labor, while each pair of pants requires 4 yards of denim and 2 hours of labor. The profit from each shirt is $40, and from each pair of pants, it is $70.

The factory wants to determine how many shirts and pants to produce daily to maximize profit.

# Example 2

SweetTreats Bakery bakes cakes and cupcakes using four resources: flour, sugar, eggs, and labor hours.

The bakery has 400 lbs of flour, 200 lbs of sugar, 300 eggs, and 200 labor hours available each day. The demand for cakes is limited to 8 per day.

Each cake requires 25 lbs of flour, 10 lbs of sugar, 6 eggs, and 15 labor hours, while each cupcake requires 5 lbs of flour, 2 lbs of sugar, 2 eggs, and 5 labor hours. The profit from each cake is $150, and from each cupcake, it is $40.

The bakery wants to determine how many cakes and cupcakes to bake daily to maximize profit.
