# Example 1

DenimWorks Factory produces shirts and pants using two resources: yards of denim and labor hours.

The factory has a maximum of 90 yards of denim and 40 labor hours available each day.

Each shirt requires 3 yards of denim and 1 hour of labor, while each pair of pants requires 4 yards of denim and 2 hours of labor. The profit from each shirt is $40, and from each pair of pants, it is $70.

The factory wants to determine how many shirts and pants to produce daily to maximize profit.
