# Problem 1

## View 1
Use simple logic.

TP = 20-5 = 15 * x
100/4 = 25 so we can only make 25 

## View 2

# 
Big data.
10GB 1TB data with excel most likely not being able to open.
So we use cloud computing (AWS, SQL.)

256 GB My computer  1TB cant even fit. 

# Breakeven Analysis 

Let's say you want to open a company. 

The money you invest in it to open it is called fixed costs (c<sub>f</sub>.)

Cost of each coffee (unit variable cost) : $5 

You sell the coffee for: $13

There is a difference between v and v<sup>*</sup>. 

v means number of units you want to sell.   
 v<sup>*</sup> means number of units required to sell in order to make $0 in profit (or in order to cover your fixed costs.)
