# Definition

At this point, we planned things, we sourced suppliers and now we have to make the products.

**Operations Management:** managing the process to create products while controlling costs & maximizing profits.

## Manufacturing Strategies

The nature of the industry may determine your manufacturing strategy.

(1) **Make-to-Stock (MTS)**  
(2) **Assemble-to-Order (ATO)**  
(3) **Make-to-Order (MTS)**  
(4) **Engineer-to-Order (MTS)**

"Lead Time" = time it takes for customer to receive the order.

### Make to Order and Stock

If you're customers want...

small lead time - then you should adopt a make to stock strategy.  
don't care - then you can adopt a make to order strategy.

### Assemble to Order (ATO)

This is a hybird of make to order and make to stock.

You have all the components of a bike so when you get the order you then **assemble** the bike and send it to the customer.

### Engineer to Order (ETO)

This is the extreme of make to order.

Here, you are making things from scratch.

For example, a cutomer may want a new ship.

Not only do you need to make the ship, you need to engineer the ship from scratch.

Here, lead time is even longer.

## Lean & Six Sigma

Both Lean and Six Sigma are philosophies - mindsets.

**LEAN** is when you go into a company that is already established and ask "Where do we have waste?" and attemps to **reduce the waste**- eliminate it.

**Six Sigma** is when you go to a company and establish a mindset of being 99.99966% excellent (because nothing can every be 100%) - as in **reducing defects** and differences in products.

Example: If you make 10,000 tennis balls then "Six sigma of those tennis balls should be good."

## Lean

LEAN is a mindset not a set of methods to reduce waste.

It should be the way everyone working in your company should think in.

Example: If you are including things nobody usese in your product, that's waste- so eliminate it. If you have a calculator and there is a button that nobody uses then that button is wasteful and you should remove it.

People thinking Lean should understnad "Value".

If customers are not willing to pay for something, then it is not valuable, therefore wasteful and should be removed.

### What defines LEAN Manufacturing

(1) **Waste Reduction:** waste can include wait times, inventories, material and people movement, processing stpes, and any other action that does not add value to the company.

**DOWN TIME**

**D**efects: if you make phones and at the end realize that the screen size is wrong  
**O**ver Production: if you make more than you needed to then that's wasteful.  
**W**aiting: if you have time between processes where no work is being done.  
**N**on-Utilized Talents: if you have people that are capable of so much more and you are not utilizing that talent.  
**T**ransporation: if you transport materials/products without needing to.  
**I**ventory: excess products or materials not being processed.  
**M**ovement: the more people moving the more distraction and wasted time there is. Limit movement.  
**E**xtra Processing: if you have unnecessary or repeated steps in a process or make products have higher quality than required.

(2) Lean Layouts

Physical Layout - have all processes be easy to reach and access in a sequence.

The Five-S's (Used to organize the workplace)

**S**ort: sort your items and keep only the needed things.  
**S**traighten: organize the items to make an efficient workflow like when you have a sticker of a tool and then you know to place the tool there.  
**S**hine: everything should be clean. If you have a production line, the machines and space should be clean. Why? If there are leaks, you will be able to see them. If the place is dirty, you won't be able to notice the leak.  
**S**tandardize Processing: clean regularly.  
**S**ustain Processing: stick to the rules.

(3) Reduce Inventory, Set up Time and Changeover Time

**Inventory:** Sometimes, because you have enough inventory, you won't notice that suppliers are supplying late. If you lower inventory, you will be able to notice the problem and fix it.

**Set Up Time:** the time it takes to prepare and format the equipment and systems for production.

**Changeover Time:** the time it takes to change the equipment and systems to produce a different product or a new batch of the same product.

(4) Small Batch Scheduling and Uniform Plant Loading

(5) LEAN Supply Chain Relationships

Management should create an environment where ideas to help the LEAN process.

(6) Workforce Commitment

People are expected to think LEAN and apply it.

(7) Continuos Improvement

Continuos attempts to improve machine breakdonw problems, setup probelems, etc.

Note: LEAN Green Practices: reducese the cost of environmental management.

## Six Sigma

### 3 Foundations of Six Sigma

(1) Quality - have a clear definition of what quality you want to achieve  
(2) Tools - have all the tools you need  
(3) People- have all workers be involved

### Six Sigma has 2 methodologies:

### DMADV

**D**efine:
**M**easure:
**A**nalyze:
**D**esign:
**V**erify:

### DMAIC (most used)

We use this method to improve something that is already going on.

**D**efine:
**M**easure:
**A**nalyze:
**I**mprove:
**C**ontrol:

Total Quality Management (not on test)

### Tools we use

### Kaoru Ishikawa Diagram (Cause & Effect Diagram)

Start with the problem and ask the right questions so we can see all possible causes of a problem to help find the root cause.

### Voice of the Customer (VOC)

This is a term used to describe the process of capturing customer expectations (stated or not) thorugh customer interviews, surveys, observation, warranty data, etc.

### Cost of Quality

**Cost of Quality:** the cost of having good and bad quality products.

**Cost of Good Quality:** Prevention costs  
**Cost of Poor Quality:** Internal or external failure costs

### Quality Tools

(1) **Check Sheet:** sheet of problems people have had. You can tell what your worst problem and use the Kaoru Ishikawa diagram to identify the problems.

(2) **Histogram:** If you don't want to go through the table and identify what are your biggest problems then plot a histogram. The higher the bar the higher the problem.

(3) **Pareto:** Bar Graph but in order. So the highest problem will be first.

(4) **Control Charts:** Helps you determine if you are in control by using limits.

(5) **Scatter Diagram:** Skipped

(6) **Flow Diagram:** Maps the flow of the whole customer experince (used by Disney to estimate waiting times for each ride.)

# Implementing LEAN and Six Sigma

Starting with LEAN is less complex than Six Sigma. Six Sigma is a bit more complex. Hence, companies start with LEAN and if they can, they implement Six Sigma.
