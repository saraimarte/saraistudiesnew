You want to do SRM on strategic suppliers and sometimes the bottle neck suppliers since they are our only options.

# Definition

**The goal for SRM:** measure and identify which suppliers can be your strategic partners and then work with them to get the benefits that will improve the company and reduce costs. To maximize the value of the relationship we have with them.

These suppliers either...

(1) provide high volume of a product.  
(2) provide lesser quantities of cruicial product.  
(3) serve in _many_ parts of the company (as in, you depend on them a lot.)

# Keys to Successful Partnerships

To have successful partnerships...

(1) **Build trust**- you won't work with a supplier you can't trust and vise versa.  
(2) **Shared Goals** - both you and the supplier need to be on the same page or the supplier might want something different than you.  
(3) **Develop Relatonships** - there will be key people in each party that will develop those relationships.  
(4) **Mutual Benefits and Needs** - both parties need to have a win-win situtation.  
(5) **Commitment and Top Management Support** - the big guys have to approve.  
(6) **Change Management** - both parties need to be prepared to manage change.  
(7) **Information Sharing & Lines of Communication** - be clear on what each party can share.  
(8) **Capabilities** - the supplier needs to be able to actually perform their job like having the right tech to meet quality and cost requirements on time.  
(9) **Continuos Improvement** - both parties must be willing to improve how capable they are to meet customer requirements.  
(10) **Performance Metrics** - you can't improve what you can't measure so make sure you have measures that are understandable and actually easy to measure + measure total cost of the process (TCO toal cost of ownership).

# Evaluating Suppliers

You need to be able to know who are the good suppliers and who are not.

To do that, you need to evaluate them by using actual metrics.

## What do we measure?

(1) **Supplier Price:** suppliers prices should be fair to you.  
(2) **Supplier Quality:** suppliers should produce good quality products.  
(3) **Financial Stability:** make sure your suppliers are not broke or will be broke.  
(3) **Support Ethics & Sustainability:** suppliers should support ethics and Sustainability.

## How do we measure?

**Weighted Criteria Evaluation System (Score Card):** Where we create performance mesures like cost, collect data on those measures, assign weights, and calculate the score and compare it to a target score.

Here, we treat it just like a supplier score card but the criteria are the factors above. We give higher weight to the factors we think are more important and then select the location with the highest weighted score.

# Certifying Suppliers

The idea is that you did all the work with the supplier to ensure you don't have to check their quality again by certifying them.

How do we certify the suppliers?

(1) **Internal Certification Program:** some companies have their own process to certify the suppliers by requiring suppliers to meet certain criteria.

(2) **External Certification Program:** sometimes companies don't have the money or resources to certify themselve so they require the suppliers to certify using external agencies and get a certificaiton of ISO 9000/ ISO 14000.

If a company tells you "I certify in ISO 9000" that means they are certified in management and quality standards.

If a company tells you "I certify in ISO 14000" that means they are certified in standards for environmental management.

<Note>

You don't need to know all 8 principles of ISO 9000 just the stuff above.

# Developing Suppliers

If we have a supplier that provides me the cartons for toothpaste but they don't have the knowledge of making the Colgate you can help them develop the skills to do that aswell like investing in their training or providing them information. This is beneficial for you because now they can help you more and it helps the supplier because they have new skills they can offer to other companies too.

## Process

(1) Identify critical products  
(2) Identify critical suppliers  
(3) Form a team  
(4) Make sure everybody is agreeing to do this  
(5) Identify what we need to develop  
(6) Make a plan  
(7) Monitor the status of the project and review plan if needed

**Early Supplier Involvement (ESI):** It can be useful to involve suppliers in the early stages of making a product because they may know of an alternative to a material that you need for your product that could be more efficient or less costly.

# Recognizing Suppliers

**Supplier Recogniction Program:** a program to recognize suppliers who do a good job.

## Benefits of Supplier Recogniction Programs

(1) Motivates suppliers to perform better  
(2) Improve supplier loyalty and commitment  
(3) Encourage suppliers to adapt to company's culture ('feel part of the family')

# SRM Systems

There are systems that track all of these things and measures them automatically. It can score suppliers, etc.

When developing an SRM system you want into take into account 5 points:

(1) Automation
(2) Integration
(3) Visibility/Clear
(4) Collaboration
(5) Optimization

# Trends in SRM

(1) Close alignment of souring with supplier relationship managemnet.
(2) Have people talk to eachother. You want your quality control person to talk to their quality control person.  
(3) Focus on innovation
(4) Investment in people & Soft Skills
