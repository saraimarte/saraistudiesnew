# <span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold;">How is the service industry different than the manufacturing industry?</span>

**1. Tangibility:** you can't touch the products...because they're services.  
**2. Involvement of the customer:** customers are more involved because they have to experience the service.  
**3. Assessment of quality:** quality is measured differently.  
**4. Labor Content:** there is much higher ratio of labor to materials in the service industry. In the service industry you need more people to serve than you do materials.  
**5. Facility Location:** services like restaurants are heavily impacted by their locations.

**Facilitating Goods:** tangible elements that come along with the service (like cash and coins for banks, cutlery or tables and chairs for restaurants.)

# Types of Service

**1. Pure Service:** offer few or no tangible products (consulting, tax prep, legal, storing facilities, education.)

**2. End Products:** offer services with tangible parts (restaurants.)

**3. State Utility:** offer services for things directly related to the customer (car repair, haircut, dry cleaning, healthcare.)

(We don't have to remember these ^)

# Service Strategies

**1. Cost Leadership:** have the lowest prices.

**2. Location and Layout:** make it easy for customers to find the location and find what they want once they arrive by having a good layout.

**3. Differentiation:** have a unique service.

**4. Focus:** have a niche of customers that you focus on.

# Service Response Logistics

How you manage your service capacity/quality, distrubution channels and waiting times.

## Not enough capacity

If there is more demand than we have the capacity to provide then you can either turn the customer away, make them wait or increase service capacity by hiring part-time employees, providing self-checkouts, etc.

## When you have too much capacity

If there is less demand, instead of getting rid of the workforce we can find other uses for the available capacity like have them do other jobs like clean bathrooms or do training. We can use demand management tactics to increase demand.

**Demand Management Tactics:** what you do to manage demand. Ex. You can say that they can get the early bird discount if they come at a certain time OR note how plane tickets are cheaper in the week than on weekends

## Challenges

Customers fluctuate.

## What does capacity look like?

**Queue**: If you have people wait you will set up queues. They help control the flow and prioritization of people waiting to receive a service. There are 3 different types of queues depending on what you want to do and what activities you're doing. Connect this with LEAN and Six Sigma.

## Types of Queues

**1. Structured Queues:** these are fixed position <s>waiting lines</s> queues like in a super market checkout line.  
**2. Unstructured Queues:** these are informal or unorganized <s>waiting lines</s> queues like in retail stores or people waiting for a taxi in an airport.  
**3. Mobile Queue:** Like the Kiosks in McDonalds or Olive Garden that you use to order food. You will be in a virtual queue. Also, if you've ever gone to the CAVE at Rutgers for some help on your CS assignments then you know you have to put yourself on a waiting list, on a queue.

# Waiting Management

**1.** Keep customers occupied.

**2.** Let customers know how much they need to wait.

**3.** Group customers together so they can keep eachother busy by talking.

# The 5 dimensions of service quality

Reliable and consistent service, responsiveness/timely service, assurance to customers, empathy, tangibles.
