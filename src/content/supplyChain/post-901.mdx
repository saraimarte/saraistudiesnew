# What is CRM?

**Customer-Centric Organization:** the philosophy of putting the customer first.

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** the means by which a company becomes a customer centric organization. It involves taking key customers, ehancing their experience so they will remain customers for life.

## Why do we do CRM?

The goal is for customers to be loyal to us, for us to aquire new customers, help meet their expectations and automate tasks.

CRM also helps us...

**Categorize customers who have similar characteristics** making it easier for us to provide marketing that applies to all of them so we can minimizie costs.

**Predict customer behaviors** which we can use to forecast demand.

Do Event Based Marketing like black friday.

Do Customer defection analysis. Helps you analyse **why a customer left**.

Do Cross-Selling: Trying to **make total purchase larger** while offering a product that complements the items you already have.
Ex. If you go and buy a burger, they will ask you if you want fries.

Do Up-Selling: Still trying to make a larger sale but they are trying to **sell you something more expensive**.  
Ex. If you go buy an ipad with the lowest memory, but they tell you to buy the ipad with more memory that's more expensive.

# What is customer Service?

Can be viewed in different lens: as a philosophy, activity, performance measure.

Generally, it is the act of _servicing_ the customers before, during and after their purchase.

**Pre-transaction services:** before the sale, customer service policies, mission statement, system flexibility.

**Transaction services:** during sale, order lead time, organizational structure.

**Post-transaction services:** complaint resolution, warranty repairs, returned items.

The right customer service...

**Seven R's Rule:** Right product, quality, quantity, place, time, customer, costs.
