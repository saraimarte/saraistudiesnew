# What is Supply Chain Management (SCM)?

**Goal of Supply Chain Management:** increase customer service while decreasing both inventory investment and operating expenses.

## (1) What is the Supply Chain?

Supply chain management starts with understanding the flow of...well, supplies.

The supply chain is a series of <s>nodes</s> <s>links</s> <s>phases</s> steps that are needed to supply a product (toothpaste tubes) or service (car wash service).

In a manufacturing company, there is you the company, the suppliers and the customers. There are different <s>types</s> <s>levels</s> tiers of both suppliers and customers. See below.

These steps are connected by warehousing and transportation.

Think about it. How do you think the finished materials suppliers get their supplies to the manufacturers? By transporting the supplies either by:

(1) Rail
(2) Air
(3) Pipeline
(4) Truck
(5) Water

I remember it as RAP + T.W like RAP and then T.W from the show <a href = "https://youtu.be/gYn1Em-4CQ4?t=13">Arthur.</a>

**Intermodal:** using a combination of transportation for one shipment.

### Supply Chain Disruption

Within the supply chain, there can be some disruptions.

If only 1 supplier stops supplying to the manufacturer (your company) and

all other suppliers are still supplying. Yet, you can't sell your goods to distributors because you're missing 1 key part of your product.

Now, the distributors will continute to sell whatever inventory they have in stock until they run out.

Once they run out, you will have to cease receiving supplies from other suppliers because you can't do anything if you don't have that 1 key part from that one supplier that's not supplying.

Hence, one disruption by one supplier can disrupt the entire supply chain.

We know that a chain is only as good as it's weakest link.

### Supply Chain Management in the Service Industry

We talk a lot about manufacturing companies that _manufacture_ products like phones or toothpaste.

Yet, there are service companies like car washes or dry cleanings.

Although these companies don't supply tangible products, they may involve the use of tangible products.

For example, car washing companies may have a supply chain for their towels they use to dry the cars after the wash. They need suppliers to supply those towels.

## (2) SCOR Model

All supply chains follow the SCOR model and so do the chapters in this class.

(1) **Plan** - Forecasting and Demand Planning, Supply Chain Planning and Inventory Management  
(2) **Source** - Purchasing Management, Strategic Sourcing, Supplier Relationship Management  
(3) **Make**- Operations Management  
(4) **Deliver**- Warehousing, Transportation, Global Logistics, Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management in the Service Industry  
(5) **Enable** (this step is happening simultaneously) - Project Management, Performance Measurement, Supply Chain Integration

## Business Models

There are 2 types of business models or companies: push and pull.

### Push Model (Made to Stock Company)

This is the most used model.

Pros: Products are always avaliable to ship to the customers.  
Cons: They may have high inventory and that's not always a good thing because they have to pay for the storage of that inventory.

Example: Crayola Crayons Manufactures. Crayola has stock of their crayons. They make to stock.

### Pull Model (Made to Order Company)

Pros: Reduces waste, flexible, orders can be customizable.  
Cons: There is pressure for the order to be perfect and on time - any mistakes can lead to customer dissatisfaction.

Example: Plane Manufactures. The plane companies don't just have planes laying around. When the planes are ordered then they are made.

**The way I remember...**

Push is made to stock because they _push_ the goods to shelves.

Pull is made to order because they _pull_ or _retain_ their making of products until someone orders.
