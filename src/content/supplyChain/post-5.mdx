Now, we're going from planning to sourcing.

# Definitions

**Procurement:** the process of selecting and vetting suppliers. It includes purchasing management, strategic sourcing, supplier relationship management.

**Request for Proposal (RFP):** a document used to determine a supplier's capability and interest in the production of a customized product or service.

**Request for Quotation (RFQ):** a document used to solicit bids from interested & qualified suppliers.

**Purchase Requisition (PR):** an internal document requesting a material like a monitor.

**Purchase Order (PO):** an external document requesting a supply from supplier, becoming legally binding ONLY when supplier accepts it.

# The Goals of Purchasing

**1.** Ensure uninterrupted flows of materials at the lowest total cost.  
**2.** Improve quality of finished goods.  
**3.** Optimize customer satisfaction.

# The Basic of Purchasing Process (The Steps)

Problem: We need caps for our toothpaste bottles. “We” = The Company

**Step 1:** We need caps for our toothpaste bottles again...I'll have to submit a PO for it but first..

**Step 2:** I have to ask for permission/authorization if needed...I got it. But before submitting the PO...

**Step 3:** I have to make a list of suppliers that can supply me these caps and evaluate them if I don’t know which supplier I’m going to use already.

**Step 4:** I will hold a bid and issue an RFP (or a RFQ) so I can get all the info I need to compare suppliers. RFP- Request for Proposal: Request this when you have not purchased from this supplier already. It's a document that includes their 'pitch' as to why you should pick them that includes prices and delivery. RFQ - Request for Quotation: Request this when you have purchased from a supplier already. Document that just includes price and delivery quote on the specific items requested. We use these in the bidding process to determine which supplier has the best price, quality, availability, delivery costs, etc. for us.

**Step 5:** After the bid, supplier #1 was selected. Finally, I can create and submit the PO. Purchase Order (PO): A document that represents the buyers formal offer to the supplier to obtain the item(s). It will list the item(s) that we need, how many we need, when we need it, where we need it to be delivered to, the prices to be paid, and any conditions related to the order. It becomes a binding contract only when supplier accepts the order.

**Step 6:** Supplier #1 confirms the PO so now the document is legally binding.

**Step 7:** Supplier fulfills the order and we receive the caps.

**Step 8:** Receipt of Goods: We have to check that the caps are in good quality and we received the exact quantity we ordered. in the PO.

**Step 9:** Receive Invoice. The supplier just sent us the invoice for the caps (sometimes the invoice comes in step 7 with the items )

**Step 10:** Do a Reconciliation (3-way match). We Check that the PO, invoice and goods receipt all have the same numbers.

**Step 11:** Payment. I just paid the suppliers the $2 +$1 for tax.

**Step 12:** Sometimes the supplier charges tax... and they did so I'm going to reclaim some (or all) of the taxes through the gov.

**Step 13:** Close the purchase order - take it out of the system.

**Step 14:** Analysis. The purchasing department analyzes by measuring efficiency and accuracy of the process.  
We can look at the time the delivery was made if the supplier was late or early. If the quantity of goods had good quality, how much didn’t etc. to measure efficiency.

**e-Procurement: the automation of the purchasing steps.**

# Financial Significance of Purchasing

**Profit-Leverage Effect of Increasing Sales: if you decrease costs of purchasing then you increase profits before tax (b/c you're saving money)**

**Return on Assets (ROA) Effect:** if you have a high ROA then that means that you're really good at generating profits from your assets.

**Inventory Turnover Effect:** the number of times the company sold through inventory in a given period (COGS/Average Inventory.) High Turnover = good b/c you are generating sales efficiently to sell inventory. Low Turnover = Not as good b/c you're not selling products efficiently or you are making/buying too much inventory for demand so you can't sell it.

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** all the costs of a product within the supply chain so Quality + Service + Delivery + Price (QSDP).

**Pre-Transaction Costs:** costs of the activities occurred before buying the product like identifying, qualifying, certifying suppliers.

**Transaction Costs:** costs of the activities that occurred during the purchase of a product like taxes, delivery, transportation, invoice.

**Post-Transaction Costs:** costs of the activities that occurred after buying the product like returns from customer, replacement, repairs.

# Make vs Buy Decision

This is a decision on whether or not to buy a material or to make it yourself.

There are quantitative (costs) and qualitative (control over quality, reliability) factors to take into consideration.

**You may want to make because:** costs are lower, no suppliers available, better quality control, it's a key item.

**You may want to buy because:** item is non-strategic (not key item), you don't have enough capacity, lack of expertise.

**Backward Vertical Integration:** when a company acquires one or more of their suppliers.

**Forward Vertical Integration:** when a company acquires one or more of their customers.

# Supplier Selection

Selecting suppliers should be based on criteria such as:

**1.** Reliability  
**2.** Quality  
**3.** capacity  
**4.** Communication capability  
**5.** Cost  
**6.** Location  

(and more)

# Organization of Purchasing

This is all about who makes the purchasing decisions which include who the suppliers are, etc.

**Centralized Purchasing:** when a purchasing department located at the company's **corporate office** makes all the purchasing decisions (avoids duplication, common supply base, lower transportation costs.)

**Decentralized Purchasing:** when a local purchasing department like in the **plant level**, makes their own purchasing decisions (less bureaucracy, local sourcing, knowledge of local requirements.)

# International Purchasing

Why would we purchase internationally? To improve quality, cost and delivery.

**1.** Because you don't have domestic capacity.  
**2.** Because you want access to better technology.  
**3.** Because you want to take advantage of low cost of labor, materials and low taxes.

In order to purchase internationally companies need to acquire specialized knowledge in...

**1.** Tarrifs.  
**2.** Laws on imports sand exports.  
**3.** Currency. How people pay-with goods or with currency.

Some challenges when purchasing internationally...

**1.** Lack of that specialized knowledge.  
**2.** Lack of communication abilities.  
**3.** Payments and managing currency.  
**4.** Different document requirements.

Some companies don't have the time to search for that specialized knowledge so they use service providers who have that knowledge like...

**1.** **Import Brokers** - agents who are able to conduct business on behalf of importers. They do the paperwork and clear products through customs.  
**2.** **Import Merchant** - people who import the goods themselves and then sell them.  
**3.** **Trading Companies**- like import merchants but at a large scale.

# Government & Non-Profit Purchasing (Skipped)

# World-Class Procurement Organization

What does a good world class Procurement organization look like? What do they do? How can they help the company?

They benchmark. They compare themselves to the best and see what they could be doing better, improve and be even better.

These companies or people also get involved in improving the purchasing function like making acquisition decisions - if a company should buy another company or not.
