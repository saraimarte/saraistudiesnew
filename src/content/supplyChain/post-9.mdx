# Chapter 9

You can have all the products done but if you can't deliver them then everything was for nothing. Which is why logistics is an imporant part of the supply chain.

Logistics includes warehousing, transporation and reverse logistics (what happens when customers return orders.)

# Warehousing

## Primary Functions

**1.** Receive products.  
**2.** Store products.  
**3.** Pick products that were ordered.  
**4.** Pack products.  
**5.** Ship products.

We will look at the types of warehouses by ownership and by funciton/purpose.

## Types of Warehouses by Ownership

**1. Public Warehouse** (like those warehouses you go and store your things in by renting a unit.) No property taxes. Flexible. But space may sometimes not be available and there may not be any customization (Like staying at a hotel.)  
**2. Contract Warehouses** (You don't own the warehouse but you rent it for x amount of years. There may be some customization but you're stuck in contract and may not be able to leave) (Like renting a house.)  
**3. Private Warehouse** (You own it. More control. Less cost. But you have to invest in making it. But if you regret building it in a location, you can't change that, you'll have to sell it) (Like buying a house.)

## Types of warehouses by their functions

Now, when we talk about suppliers- the suppliers are the manufacuring companies.

Also, if you look at the slides, they use the word "products" but I like to replace that with "orders" because it makes more sense.

### Consolidation Warehouse

Warehouse that receives products from different suppliers and mixes the products and ships them to customers.

Warehouses should be placed closer to suppliers to optimize the truck loads.

Sometimes, customers will order from multiple companies. To be more efficient, instead of sending over a truck that is not full to travel all the way to the customer (aka being wasteful), companies will send their product over to a consolidation warehouse that's **closer to them**, where all the products will be <s>unified</s> consolidated into larger shipments (fuller trucks) and _then_ sent over to customers who are far away.

### <span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold;">Break-Bulk Warehouse</span>

Warehouse that receives shipments that are full and break them into smaller shipments that will be shipped to customers.

You want warehouse to be close to customers and far away from suppliers.

Sometimes, multiple customers will order products from the same company and that company will have a full truckload (FTL) of their products to ship so they ship them to a break-bull warehouse that is **closer** to the customer. Here, the products are **broken** into smaller shipments or less than truckload shipments (LTL) and sent over to the customers who are very close to the warehouse.

### Cross-Dock Warehouse

Like Amazon. Multiple suppliers will supply to one dock and then from that dock we will distribute to customers.

It's a combination of both previous functions.

Here, multiple suppliers will send over a truck full of the same product to the warehouse. One Customer may have ordered product A and product C. So, their truck will be full of A and C and will be sent over to them.

Intead of suppliers having to send the same truck to all customers who ordered the product, they will send it to a cross-docking warehouse that will take make a truck full of products that are going to the same location/customer.

# Warehouse Network

(AKA how many warehouses should we have?)

## Single Warehouse

Less complicated and less expensive. Inventory costs will be lower. May take longer to deliver the product.

## Multiple Warehouses

Everybody gets their products faster because you have a warehouse more near to them than others but it's more complex and expensive.

## Hybird Approach

One example would be the **hub-and-spoke** where there is a centralized warehouse (the hub) that holds the inventory and it's linked to smaller warehouses (spokes) that hold some inventory. The hub feeds the spoke as needed.

Operating and inventory costs are lower and customer service is overall better.

## Third Party Logistics (3PL)

Some companies have other companies take care of their logistics like UPS or FedEx. You can use more than one.

**Advantages:** Costs less than doing it yourself. They are experts and efficient.

**Disadvantages:** You are dependent on them.

# Transporation

(1) Rail (most capable, less flexible than trucks)  
(2) Air (most expensive, less capable, fastest)  
(3) Pipeline (least expensive, most inflexible, most reliable)  
(4) Truck (most used, most flexible)  
(5) Water (slow, inflexible, inexpensive)

I remember it as RAP + T.W like RAP and then T.W from the show <a href = "https://youtu.be/gYn1Em-4CQ4?t=13">Arthur.</a>

**Intermodal:** using a combination of transportation for one shipment.

## Trucks

More flexible.

80% of products moved in the U.S are moved by truck.

## Rails

Cost is better than truck because you can transport a lot more with a train than a truck.

Less flexible because you need rails.

Usually combined with trucks. Trucks carry the products to the rails.

## Air

Most expensive. Good for urgent needs.

Usually not used for consumer goods or raw materials.

Even less flexible because some things you need to transport might not fit.

Usually combined with trucks. Trucks carry the products to the rails.

## Pipeline

Lowest cost per unit.

Very inflexible because you can only ship gases or liquids.

## Water/Sea

Inexpensive. Very slow and inflexible.

Usually combined with trucks because once shipments get to the port they get put into a truck.

## Sometimes you have less than a truck load to ship...

So you go to a freight forwarder who fills a truck with your products and another companies product that are going to the same place.

## Logistics Management Software Applications

There are logistic systems part of the ERP that are in charge of transporation, warehousing, and things that are imported or exported.

**1. Warehouse Management Systems (WMS):** tracks flows of goods from receiving the products until shipped.

**2. Transportation Management Systems (TMS):** selects the best mix of transportation services and their prices.

**3. Global Trade Management Systems (GTM):** gives you all documentation and global visibility to meet international trade regulations.

# Reverse Logistics

When a customer returns an order.

It's the process of moving a product from the customer back to where it came from (a backward supply chain.)

It's imporant to have good reverse logistics b/c it protects the company's reputation and brand or a customers view on the product which can impact future sales.

## The 5 R's of Reverse Logistics.

These are 5 cases where reverse logistics are involved.

**1.** Customer **returns** products b/c of damanges, defects, etc.  
**2.** Customer returns products b/c the company **recalled** the products b/c they realized they were unsafe.  
**3.** When products are returned, they are sometimes not thrown away, instead companies **repair** them and return it to stock.  
**4.** When products are returned, they are sometimes returned because customers just weren't happy with them not because anything was defective so companies just **repackage** the product and return them to inventory.  
**5.** When products are returned, companies must find safe and cost efficient ways to throw them away so they sometimes **recycle** components.

# Chapter 10 Global Logistics

Companies be anywhere in the world.

They do this because of technology, lower labor costs, transportation or open markets.

## Facility Types

**1. <span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold;">Offshore Factory:</span>** located where materials or labor are less expensive. (Clothes => Asia)  
**2. Source Factory:** an offshore factory but has skilled workers.  
**3. Server Factory:** you look at everything and then locate where the incentives is the deciding factor. Where you are given incentives to do something or to simply just locate there (Exeptions of taxes).  
**4. Contributor Factory:** It's a server factory that also develops and engineers products they make.  
**5. Outpost Factory:** located where you are close to research facilities, suppliers, universities that will help you.  
**6. Lead Factory:** where companies try/test things out first like technology or developments that you later roll down to other factories or a place where you send people to train. It's like your model factory.

## Factors that play a role in where you will locate your facility:

**1. Taxes and Incentives:** are there incentives? are you saving money? will there be taxes that you would have in this location?

**2. Currency Stability:** currency should be stable. If you pay people in the U.S and Brazil, and the currency of dollars or real changes a lot that can be a problem.

**3. Access and Proximity to Markets:** are you close to your customers to deliver to them?

**4. Labor Issues:** labor should be available. Is there labor avaliable? How many? How are there skills? How does unemployment look like? How is the turnover/how long do they stay working?

**5. Right-to-work laws:** do you want to be in a state that supports unions and worker's rights?

**6. Access to Suppliers and Cost:** are your suppliers close to you?

**7. Utilities:** do you have enough utilities for your products? Lot's of electricity? Water? Gas? At a reasonable cost?

**8. Environmental Issues:** do you pollute a lot? do you do things that are not environmentally friendly?

**9. Land:** is there land avaliable?

**10.<span style = "color:red; font-weight:bold;">Quality of Life:</span>** will people live here? things can be cheap but is the location good for your workers to live here? Will they be able to have a life? educate their children? feel safe?

**11. Business Clusters:** will you be close to people who are doing similar things as you so they can help you out?

Note: Homework 3 not given during the summer. It has a score card equivalent for locations considering all the factors above.

## How to select a location?

You use a weighted-factor rating model aka just a score card for locations just like we used when selecting suppliers but this time, the criteria scored is based on the factors mentioned above and you give factors a weight of importance.

# Chapter 10 International Trade

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">
  Why operate/sell internationally?
</span>

**1. Increase revenue:** more opportunities to earn money/ get more customers.

**2. Increase sourcing options:** if you run out of local suppliers you can use international suppliers.

Why **not** operate/sell internationally?

**1. Tarrifs**  
**2. Custom Regulations**  
**3. Transportation of goods across borders**

## International Trade Compliance

An average shipment across the borders consists of:

**1.** 35 documents.  
**2.** Comply witth 600+ laws and 500 trade agreements.  
**3.** Contact with 25 groups like customs, freight forwarders, etc.

## Trade Compliance Systems

Sometimes it's hard to keep up with compliance so companies use these systems the keep current with all the changing laws. It can also automate every transaction (Adv: avoid fines, inc level of compliance, faster release of shipments.)

## Import Process

CBP- Customs and Border Protection

When shipments are imported to the US, the <s>owner</s> purchaser has to fill entry documents at the port of entry.

Shipments are not legally entered into the US until it has arrived at the port, CBP has authorized it based on the documents filled by the purchaser and duties have been paid.

Duties are based on classification and valuation of the product, where it's coming from, etc.

**Free Trade Zones (FTZ's):** Physical areas in the U.S where you can leave your goods so you don't have to pay duities for them because they are technically not inside the country yet.

## Export Process

When a shipment is being exported, the shipper needs to file export documents for the goods.

Shipments must comply with export administration regulations as in knowing all the facts about the shipment like what it is, where it's going, who will use it, etc.

## Global Logistics Intermediaries (3rd parties)

**1. Custom Brokers:** move shipments through customs and handle documentation.

**2. International Freight Forwarders:** move goods to and from foreign location.

**3. Trading companies:** they put together buyers and sellers and handle all the imports, exports, documentation.

**4. Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (NVOCC):** freight forwarders but for ocean shipments.
