# What is Strategic Sourcing?

**Sourcing:** The process of finding one supplier.

**Strategic Sourcing:** A comprehensive analysis that helps find the **key suppliers**.

Why do strategic sourcing?

(1) Improve financials  
(2) Improve product quality  
(4) Reduce cost of materials  
(5) Optimize number of suppliers

# Developing Successful Sourcing Strategies

These are ways to develop good strategies or to know which strategies to use.

(1) **Sourcing:** **single source** (purchasing a good or service from 1 supplier. You can get better prices but may not be reliable strategy = big risk) or **multi source** (Purchasing good or service from multiple suppliers. Less risk. May not have the best price.)

(2) **Spend Analysis:** You collect, clean, categorize, and analyze your spending data for the purpose of decreasing costs, monitoring compliance, improving efficiency, reducing suppliers per category. You can get data from historical spending, from future demand forecasts and supplier spending.

# Sourcing Strategy Categories

There are different strategies for different types of items.

We organize these strategies in a Kraljic matrix.

CHART.

The goal is to get bottleneck items to become non-critical items.

The way we do that is buy creating more suppliers so we would invest in a company and help them start making that bottleneck item like a certain chemical that way there is no longer one supplier.

Leverage Items: Trying to use my leverage of having multiple sources and I spend a lot of money to get the best deals from the suppliers. You just want to save money.

Strategic Items: You spend a lot of money and have little suppliers so make sure you have good relationships with those suppliers.

**Q:** Tell me what you would do to move from bottleneck to non-critical?

# Supplier Base Selection

**Supply Base:** The group of suppliers that a company uses.

**Supply Base Optimization:** the more you reduce your suppliers, the more efficient you can be. But don't reduce too much because you don't want to end up in a bottle neck issue.

After you have a supply base you can categorize your suppliers.

One category would be,

**Preferred Suppliers:** the suppliers that perform consistently well. These are the suppliers who you would want to keep when you optimize your supplier base.

# Strategic Alliance Development

Preferred Suppliers are those who are ideal to create alliance with.

What types of alliances?

(1) Investing in them so they can supply better quality or more volume of the goods you need.

(2) Rewarding Supplier Performance: if you are a company like Colgate and you recognize a supplier, they can use that recogniction to get contracts with other businesses.

(3) Pain and Gain Agreements/Provisions: there could be provisions in the contract that say suppliers will receive rewards (gains) or punishments (pains) that motivate them (or pressure them) to do well.

# Supplier Certification

Helps with quality control because it certifies suppliers in regards to their quality of products.

If a supplier has been certified then you don't need to check for quality again.

More on types of certification in chapter 7.

# Additional Sourcing Concepts

## Reverse Auctions

If you have leverage items then you can hold a reverse auction because you should take advantage of your leverage over the suppliers avaliable because there are many so you can have them compete to give you the lowest price.

## Vendor Managed Inventory

Sometimes, suppliers can manage your inventory so you can save storage costs and your inventory will be 0.

## Supplier Co-location

When a represnataive of the supplier actually works in the buyer's purchasing department to forecast demand, place orders and monitor inventory.

# Ethics and Sustainability

**Ethical Sourcing:** takes into account the ethics of suppliers when sourcing them.

For example, if there is a supplier who engages in child labor- you would not want to use them because they are not making a positive impact.

**Sustainability Sourcing:** ensures that the needs of the supply chain are met without negatively affecting the environment, society or the economy in the future.
