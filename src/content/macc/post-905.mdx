## What is the difference between absorption and variable costing?

Absorption considers both variable and fixed costs under inventoriable costs.
Variable Costing only considers variable costs as inventoriable costs- fixed manufacturing costs are put under operating expenses or what we call period costs.

You have already done this.

Absoprotion costing is just making the income statment you first learned in chapter 2.

Variable costing is just making the contribution margin income statement you learned in chapter 3.

## Example 1

Sara sells a notebook for $30 per unit. Last year, 30,000 notebooks were produced but only 20,000 were sold. Other information for the period includes:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align:start">Description</th>
    <th style="text-align:start">Amount</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Direct Materials</td>
    <td>$10.00 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Direct Manufacturing Labor</td>
    <td>$5.00 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Variable Manufacturing Costs</td>
    <td>$2.00 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fixed Manufacturing Costs</td>
    <td>$10.00 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sales Commissions</td>
    <td>$1.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fixed Administrative Expenses</td>
    <td>$2.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Calculate the operating income using both absorption and variable costing.

## Example 2

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align:start">Description</th>
    <th style="text-align:start">Amount</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Beginning inventory, January 1, 2023</td>
    <td>50,000 units</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ending inventory, December 31, 2023</td>
    <td>22,000 units</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2023 sales</td>
    <td>250,000 units</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Selling price </td>
    <td>$25.00 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Variable manufacturing cost per unit</td>
    <td>$2.00 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Variable operating (marketing) cost per unit sold</td>
    <td>$3.50 per unit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fixed manufacturing costs</td>
    <td>$1,200,500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Denominator-level machine-hours</td>
    <td>4,500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Standard production rate</td>
    <td>10 units per machine-hour</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fixed operating (marketing) costs</td>
    <td>$850,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Calculate the operating income using both absorption and variable costing.
