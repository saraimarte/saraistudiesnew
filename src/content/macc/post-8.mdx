Have you ever had wings?

No, sorry not those wings. I mean these wings,

Where do you get them?

Wingstop? or are you more of a buffalo wild wings type of person?

Either way, when you walk into wingstop you don't go to just buy one single wing.

You go to buy a basket of wings.

Now, that basket may contain bone-in wings and boneless wings.

Let's say you order that basekt. (Although, I would never, i'm an all bone-in wings type of girl tyvm.)

Notice that in the basket there are two different types of wings- two different _goods_.

This introduces the question of how in the world wide web do we make a basket that will make us profits.

How do we know how many of each type of wing to put in?

How many baskets does wingstop need to sell to break even?

What's the right _bundle_ of wings, the right _sales mix_ of wings, the right _basket_ of wings? (All terms can be interchangeably used.)

Let's find out with an example.

### Example 1|

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl1.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

### Bundle Method

### Weighted Average Method

### Problem 1

The company Bath and Body Works has three product lines of lotions- A, B and C with contribution margins of $5, $6, and $4, respectively. The marketing department informs us that budgeted sales will be 120,000 units in the next quarter, of which 30,000 units are of A, 50,000 units of B, and 40,000 units of C. Fixed costs for the upcoming quarter are $390,000.

What is the total contribution margin when 120,000 units are sold?

### Problem 2

The company Bath and Body Works has three product lines of lotions- A, B and C with contribution margins of $5, $6, and $4, respectively. The marketing department informs us that budgeted sales will be 120,000 units in the next quarter, of which 30,000 units are of A, 50,000 units of B, and 40,000 units of C. Fixed costs for the upcoming quarter are $390,000.

What is Bath and Body Work's breakeven point in units and dollars respectively?

### Problem 3

The company Bath and Body Works has three product lines of lotions- A, B and C with contribution margins of $5, $6, and $4, respectively. The marketing department informs us that budgeted sales will be 120,000 units in the next quarter, of which 30,000 units are of A, 50,000 units of B, and 40,000 units of C. Fixed costs for the upcoming quarter are $305,000.

What is Bath and Body Work's breakeven point in units and dollars respectively?
