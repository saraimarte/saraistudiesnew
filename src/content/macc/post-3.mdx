# Intro

The end goal of this chapter is to complete an income statement, which you should be familiar with from financial accounting.

An income statement just states how much you really earned. It's your Revenues - Expenses = Net Income.

In managerial, expenses are more thought of as costs so it's really Revenues - Costs = Net Income.

However, in managerial (for now) we will do Revenues - Costs = Operating Income (Net Income is after taxes).

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl2.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

But what is considered Revenues and what is considered costs?

Well it all starts with the value chain.

# The Value Chain

Value Chain: Is the chain of steps a business takes to produce value (a product/service).

All busineses start with researching and developing a product, then they design the product, then they produce (manufacture) the product and so on.

Within each of those steps there are research and development costs, design costs and production (manufacturing) costs.

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl3.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

Every cost that falls under the green steps above goes under operational costs in the income statement (Including GAS Costs, General, Administrative, Sales Costs. Basically any cost that has nothing to do with producing the product in the plant/factory).

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl4.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

And the only costs left are production costs. In the production of a product, there's the manufacturing of the product and with manufacturing comes manufacturing costs.

If we were a company that manufactures cars...

Total manufacturing costs consist of

<li style="list-style:none">(1) Direct Materials DM (steel, tires) </li>
<li style="list-style:none">
  (2) Direct Labor DL (workers on the assembly line) 
</li>
<li style="list-style:none">
  (3) Manufacturing Overhead MOH (rent, electricity, insurance of the plant) 
</li>

Take a lucky guess at which are the direct costs. As for Manufacturing Overhead- that's just a fancy way of saying indirect costs.

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

Now, these costs are taken through the inventory system.

**1.** The following information relates to Smith Company for 2020:

Direct Materials used $10,000  
Cost of goods manufactured &nbsp; $14,000  
Direct Manufacturing Labor &nbsp; $15,000  
Manufacturing Overhead &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $35,000

What are the total manufacturing costs inccured for the year?

<Solution>

**Answer: $60,000**

# The Inventory System

The inventory system is made up of 3 accounts.

<li style="list-style:none">(1) Direct Materials DM </li>
<li style="list-style:none">(2) Work In Process WIP</li>
<li style="list-style:none">(3) Finished Goods FG </li>

To make a car, we first need material that goes directly into making the car hence the name <i> Direct </i> Materials. Let's say we take some steel and start making the car.

Once we take the steel and start to make the car with it, we are now in the <i> process </i> of making the car hence the name Work In <i> Process </i> but once we take more material and finish the car those costs go into Finished Goods because the car is <i> finished </i> hence the name <i> Finished </i> Goods.

Now the good (the car) is just sitting in our plant waiting to be sold but once it sells the cost of the car <i> sold </i> is now moved out of the inventory system and into - guess where? - the Cost of Goods <i> sold </i> account. Who would have thought!

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl5.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

And that ladies and gentlemen is how we get COGS.

And COGS is what goes under revenue in the income statement.

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl6.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

voila!

Okay, now practice identifying which costs are manufacturing or operating costs.

Note: Manufacturing Costs = Inventoriable Costs

Note: Operating Costs = Period Costs

**1.** Sarai's ToyxRus is a toy manufacturing company. Unit costs of one of it's toys, toy AK124, are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Direct materials</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Direct manufacturing labor</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Fixed manufacturing overhead</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Variable manufacturing overhead</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Office Supplies</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">General Expenses</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Sales Commissions</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left;">Distribution Costs</td>
    <td style="text-align: right; padding-left: 40px;">$6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

What are the inventoriable costs per unit for toy AK124?

<Solution>

**Answer: $50**

# The Point

The point is- that the goal is to make up an income statement but to do that you need your Revenues and Costs.

Here revenue will mostly always be given to you but you have to identify the two different types of costs (1) Manufacturing Costs (2) Operating Costs.

Manufacturing Costs is just a fancy way of saying cost of goods completed and sold.

(Manufacturing Costs are also known as <i>inventoriable</i> costs because they're costs that go through the <i>inventory</i> system.)

Think about it, the cost of the goods you sold in a manufacturing company is the same cost of the goods you manufactured. Because to sell the goods you had to manufacture them in the first place no?

Also the fact that COGS is made up of DM + DL + MOH which <i> are </i> manufacturing costs.

Operating Costs are literally every other cost.

Operating costs are any costs that are not inccured in the manufacturing/plant.

(They are also known as period costs b/c they are costs we record in the period in which they were inccured in.)

Again, it includes costs in every step of the value chain except for the production/manufacturing step (the costs inccured during that step are manufacturing costs.)

Another way to remember operating costs are GAS (General, Adminitrative, Sales Costs).

So, what you will be doing for this entire chapter is not coming up with an income statement-that's the easy part.

Instead, it's finding COGS by taking the costs through the inventory system.

To do that, you need to be comfortable with classifying costs and determining if they're a manufacturing cost or an operational cost in the first place.

So...now let's learn how to take those costs through the inventory system to get COGS in the next note.
