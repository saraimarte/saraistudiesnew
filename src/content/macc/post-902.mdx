Chapter 6 is all about having an end goal and budgeting for what you need to reach that goal. It is broken up into two parts, the operating budget and the cash budget.

The operating budget - what you need to operate in order to reach the goal

The cash budget - what you need in order to operate

Let me put this into perspective. If your goal is to go on a vacation at the end of the year, you work backwards and ask, "What do I need to go on vacation?" Well, you need to buy plane tickets. So, to buy the plane tickets, you need cash for that. But you don't have all that cash right now so you start budgeting for that amount so that you're able to reach the goal of having a vacation!

In managerial accounting terms, sometimes the goal is to end up with a certain amount of finished goods. To reach that goal however, you need to work your way backwards and ask, "Okay, in order to reach that goal, what do I need?" Sometimes it will require you to budget for a certain amount of direct materials, a certain amount of direct material purchases, a certain amount of direct labor. This is called an operating budget- where you budget for what you need to operate in order to produce a certain amount of finished goods.

However, in order to operate you need cash. So, you make sure you have the cash you need to operate, to hire that direct labor, to buy those direct materials so that you can end up with a certain amount of finished goods but in order to know how much cash can you use- you have to find out how much cash you will have avaliable to use.

So, that's the concept, and we're going to dive straight into an example for both budgets.

### Example: Operating Budget

Susan wants to have a finished goods ending inventory of $12,000 on February 31 2020. The sales budget is $40,000. The finished goods beginning inventory on December 31 2019 is $10,000. The direct materials beginning inventory is $60,000. Direct material ending inventory is $50,000. Note that 3 units of direct materials are needed to make 1 unit of a finished good. How many units of direct materials should the company purchase during the 2 months starting December 31st ending February 31st?

(1) LIST Everything

Sales Budget 40,000
FG BI DEC 31 10,000
FG Target EI Feb 31 12,000
DM BI DEC 31 60,000
DM EI FEB 31 50,000
3 units of DM are needed to make 1 unit of FG

(2) SET UP YOUR DM AND FG ACCOUNT

(3) FILL IN EVERYTHING THEY GIVE YOU

(4) WORK YOUR WAY BACKWARDS TO GET WHAT YOU NEED TO OPERATE TO GET TO THE GOAL

### Example: Cash Budget B

With these types of questions the only account you need is the cash account.

The Dynamic Endeavors Company expects its February sales to be 15% higher than its January sales of $220,000. Purchases were $130,000 in January and are expected to be $180,000 in February. All sales are on credit and are collected as follows: 30% in the month of the sale and 65% in the following month. Purchases are paid 45% in the month of purchase and 55% in the following month. The cash balance on February 1 is $15,000. Determine the cash balance on February 28.

A) $79,290

B) $81,400

C) $93,200

D) $105,350
