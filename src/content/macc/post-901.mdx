This is exactly the same as chapter 4. We are just allocating OH.

The only difference is that we now recognize that different activitites drive overhead costs in different departments.

For example, do you think it's fair that we allocate OH costs based on machine hours for every department?

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;">

What if we had an HR department? What drives up their costs is not machine hours...it's humans.

So if we allocate OH based on the machine hours the HR department uses- that would not be an accurate reflection of what they're costing us because guess what-they're probably not using any machine hours.

They're managing *humans* not running machines.

So, we may end up with allocating them $0 in OH when really they're costing us a lot by managaing so many employees but that's not reflected with traditional costing because we are only allocating costs based on one activity/driver and that is machine hours and not employees. 

But that changes in chapter 5.

Again, in chapter 5 we recognize that different activitites drive overhead costs in different departments.

For the HR department -> Activity that drives up costs are humans.  

For the R&D department -> Activity that drives up costs are number of R&D projects.  

For the Customer Service department -> Activity that drives up costs are the number of customers that call in.

Hence, it would make more sense if we had budgeted overhead rates based on what drives up or down the OH costs in _each_ department.

What chapter 5 does, is find a BOHR for each department and then allocate OH based on those BOHRates.
