The problem: Can you afford to hire a new worker or not?

One factor to consider is if it's worth hiring this new worker. As in, will they catch on quickly to the job or will they take a long time to get used to things?

The Solution: Find out how long it will take a new worker to catch up.

How do we do that?

There are two methods: (1) incremental method and (2) Cumulative Average method

## Incremental Method

The idea is that everytime you double the amount of units that you make, you will get better with time.

Make sense right, the more practice, the better?

For these problems, you will always be given the learning curve.

Let's start with an example.

So I came up with a little acronym for these problems: USAT.

US**A**T - use it for the cumlative **A**verage method

US ̷A̷ T - use it for incremental method but without the A

U: Units  
S: Single time  
A: Average Time  
T: Total Time
