No, CVP doesn't mean customer value proposition you management peeps.

It means cost-volume profit analysis.

What do you think it's all about?

Costs, Volume and Profits!

(Volume means amount of units btw.)

CVP analysis helps managers answer the question, "How are revenues, total costs, or operating income going to be effected if I change either the costs or the volume of the products sold?"

They ask this question because it helps them see the various outcomes they can have.

Butttt out of all the different amounts of units they sell or prices they can sell their goods for, managers will select the option that will give them the highest operating income. In other terms, the most amount of $$ mula $$.

As my marco prof always says, two main goals of a CEO (in this case- of a manager) are to (1) maximize profits and (2) decrease expenses.

And we know from our fancy financial accounting skills,

the more operating income you're left with, the more profit you'll have at the end.

mmm okay- so, many managers who do CVP analysis use the Contribution Income Statement to help them see the effects of costs on operating income more accurately.

This means, that we're going from using this

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl1.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

to using this

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl2.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

What's contribution margin?

It is simply what's left over of revenues to cover fixed costs.

We can also use CM to find how much each product _contributes_ to covering fixed costs- we call this CM/unit read as "Contribution Margin per Unit".

Before I show you how to find all these things, let me give you a picture of what all these components look like in a car manufacturing company.

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={vid1.src} alt="vid1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

Remember, total DM are always variable costs because they depend on how many units are produced. The more cars you produce the more materials go into them. DM in this case can be steel. Let's say that that we had total DM costs of $200 and we sold $500 worth of cars (so prob 1 car lol).

When we subtract variable costs from revenues we get contribution margin. It is, again, how much is left to cover fixed costs. We have $300 of CM.

What are fixed costs?

Let's say that the only fixed costs we had were for the rent of the factory we make the cars in of $100.

So now we subtract fixed costs from CM. $300 - $100 and we get $200 of operating income!

Then, we put those components into the CM Income Statement.

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={vid2.src} alt="vid1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

voila!

Okok, enough talking, the best way to learn CVP is to do it.

Let's start.

### Example 1| Fill in the blanks

This example will let you practice using the number 1 tool for this chapter- the system!

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl4.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

For the next topic, you need to know the mother formula. Personally, I don't memorize it, I derive it from the CM income statement.

Here is a video deriving the formula- I would do example 2 first and then watch this if you don't get it.

### Example 2| Breakeven Analysis | Find the amount of units to be sold and total revenue needed to be made in order to break even.

Given:  
SP (Selling Price) $500  
VC/U $100  
FC $1000  
AR (Actual Revenue) $2000

### Example 2B| Margin of Safety (in dollars and %)| Find out how safe you are until you no longer are making profit (aka breaking even.)

## Finishing the Income Statement

We know from our fancy financial accounting skills that income statements don't just end with operating income (OI)- they end with net income (NI).

What's the difference, well NI = OI- taxes.

It's literally the same thing we've been doing except now we're just throwing taxes into the equation. See,

<div style="object-fit:contain">
  <img src={imgurl3.src} alt="vid1" width="100%" height="auto" />
</div>

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;">

yes.

Now let's practice CVP with taxes!

### Example 1

### Example 2

### Other Examples

Company XYZ breaks even when 200 units are sold. How many units would the company have to sell if they want to reach an operating income of $20,000, assuming the selling price per unit is $15 and variable costs per unit are $20.

A.
B.
C.
D.
