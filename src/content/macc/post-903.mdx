Last chapter we made budgets.

Remember, budgets are just numbers we as managers estimate in the beginning of a period.

Not everything goes as planned though.

For example, we can estimate that we will make 15 cars by the end of the year but then our actual production at the end of the year could end up being 5 cars.

This chapter is all about calculating the difference between what you estimated at the start of the period vs what actually happend at the end of the period.

We call these differences variances.

Sometimes these variances are good, sometimes they are bad.

Good variances are called favorable variances.

Bad variances are called unfavorable variances.

Whether a variance is good or bad depends on what you're comparing. In this case our variance is 10 (15-5).

But is it a good or bad variance?

Well, we made less cars than we planned for- and that is not a good thing.

It's bad.

So this would be an unfavorable variance of 10 cars.

But if you were comparing costs and let's say you estimated your costs were going to be $15 but they ended up being $5.

Then your variance is still $10 but is the variance good or bad?

Well, costs went _down_ so that difference is _good_ so hence a favorable variance of $10.

See, whether or not a variance is unfavorable or favorable depends on what you're comparing.

Less production is not good but less costs are good.

Here, is a cheat sheet you can reference while you're doing the problems.

<FAQ question= "Cheat Sheet">

    Tip: Everytime you do a problem- try writing down the formula first, then refer to this sheet to get what you're missing. Keep doing this and you'll train your brain to recall the formulas and you won't need to look at the sheet anymore!

    Note: I also have a way I remember them without looking at the sheet. See the example videos where I explain it.

    **Formulas**

    **Static Budget Variance** = Actual - Static

    **Flexible Budget Variance** = Actual - Flex

    **Sales Volume Variance** = Flex - Static

    **Price Variance** = Actual - Flex Input

    Tells us if we paid more or less than we expected to pay.

    **Efficiency Variance** = Flex Input - Flex

    Tells us if we used more or less input that we expected to use.

    **Spending Variance** = Actual - Flex (same as static) *For FC (It's the same as price variance for VC) (For FC Spending Variance is also the same as the flexible budget variance.)

    **Production Volume Variance** = Flex(same as static) - Allocated

    *The sign does not determine whether or not a variance is unfavorable or favorable- it depends on what you're comparing.

    **When to use each chart?**

    U R VC CM FC OI Chart - When static, flex and sales volume variances are asked for.

    OITRT Chart - When Price and Efficiency Variance are asked for.

    Flexible Budget - Uses Actual Output and static rates (SP/u and VC/u).

    Flex **Input** Budget - Uses Actual **Input** and static rates.

    Note: In chapter 8, Flex Input turns into allocated for FC.

    Spending and Flexible Budget Variance is the same for FC.

    Flexible Budget turns to being the same thing as the static budget-because you can't flex fixed costs. They're fixed. Not flexible.

## FAQ

<FAQ question="Does the sign of the variance matter? Does it tell me if the variance is unfavorable or favorable?">
  No to both! If a variance is unfavorable or favorable depends on what you're
  comparing. If you're comparing costs vs income your variances may be the same
  number but will be different U or F.
</FAQ>

<FAQ question = " When analysing the efficiency variance, which one do we want to be better? ">

The Flex Input.

Ex. If you're comparing Total DL Costs then you would want your flex input to be less than your flexible budget.

Let's say Flex Input Total DL Costs = $468,000 and Flexible Budget Total DL Costs = $520,000. Then having lesser costs in the flex input than the flex budget is a good thing- so the variance of $52,000 is favorable.

Ex. If you're comparing OI then you- nothing. When comparing OI you don't use the Flex Input budget.
