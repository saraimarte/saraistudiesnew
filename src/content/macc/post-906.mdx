<Solution>


### High Low Method

These questions will give you actual data. They will give you costs and drivers. You have to pick the highest and lowest point in the data based on the driver (x) NOT whatever y is.

Use PB&J

P - P for find the two **p**oints.  
 B - B for find '**b**' the slope with the two points.  
 A - A for find '**a**' the constant intercept by plugging in a point and slope.  
 J - J for **j**ust write the function because you're done!

### Linear Regression Method

These questions will give you a bunch of random numbers you won't understand. The only things you need are your a, b and r<sup>2</sup>

You use r<sup>2</sup> to tell which a and b to use if they give you multiple regression data

The higher the r<sup>2</sup> the better the results so you want to use those results to make your equation.

The 'a' and the 'b' will always be under coefficients. There are only two coefficients in an equation 'a' and 'b'. They will tell you the constant and that is 'a' meaning the other coefficient has to be 'b'.

</Solution>

# The Idea

The whole point of this chapter (at least the first part) is to find a function or an equation that estimates the costs of your company.

There are two methods of doing so, one is more accurate than the other.

<li style="list-style:none">1. High-Low Method </li>

<li style="list-style:none">2. Linear Regression </li>

The Linear Regression method is more accurate because it finds the line that best fits the data while the high-low method just takes the highest and lowest point of the data and makes a line out of that.

# Interpreting The Function

Before finding the equations from given data, you need to make sure what the equation is telling you. You can skip this part if you know your stuff already.

In this chapter, you will deal with the mitochondria of highschool math and that was y = mx + b. But instead we write it in a different format:

Y = a + bX

This is literally y = mx+ b but b is now your slope instead of your intercept and instead of m we have a and a is the intercept now.

y = output (dependent variable)  
x = driver (independent variable)  
a = fixed costs (constant)  
b = variable cost per unit (constant)(slope)  
bX = total variable costs

Let's say you make pizzas.

This equation tells you the manufacturing costs of the pizzas you make.

In this case, the costs of your pizza are **based** on how many pizzas you make.

So what's your **driver**? The amount of pizzas you make.

Take the following equation,

Y = 25 + 2.50X

y = cost of X amount of pizzas  
x = amount of pizzas (what drives the costs to go up or down)  
a = maybe rent + salaries  
b = maybe cost of sauce + cost of olives  
bX = total variable cost of sauce and cost of olives per amount of pizzas we made

**What are the estimated costs of making 3 pizzas?**

Y = 25 + 2.50(3)  
Y = 32.50

So, the estimated total cost of making 3 pizzas is $32.50

# You Try

Sarai's company manufactures cars. The company's manufacturing cost allocation base is the amount of cars the company makes. The company's fixed costs are $5000 and every car has variable manufacturing costs of $1000. What is the cost equation for Sarai's company? What are the costs of making 5 cars? Respectively.

<li style="list-style:none">A) Y = 1000 + 5000x; $26,000 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">B) Y = 4000 + 5000x; $65,000 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">C) Y = 5000 + 1000x; $10,000 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">D) Y = 1000 + 4000x; $21,000 </li>

<Solution>

**Answer: C**

**Part 1**

fixed costs = $5000  
 variable costs = $1000 per car  
 x = number of cars  
 y = cost of x amount of cars

So, Y = 5000 + 1000x

**Part 2**

x = 5 cars  
 Y = 5000 + 1000(5) = $10,000

What are the estimated companys total costs for the next month given that they expect to use 453 machine hours, still have 1,200 ft of space, and distribute 1,420 units?

<li style="list-style:none">A) $5,082 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">B) $14,072 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">C) $9,342</li>

<li style="list-style:none">D) $17,342 </li>

<Solution>

**Answer: D**

Cost function for Rent Expenses (Fixed):  
 y = 8000

Cost function for Distribution costs (Variable):  
 y = 3(number of units distributed)

Cost function for Maintenance costs (Mixed):  
 y = 3270 + 4(machine hours)

Cost Function of the company:  
 y = 8000 + 3270 + 4(machine hours) + 3(units distributed)

So, when you plug in 453 for machine hours and 1,200 for units distributed into the company's general cost function you get $17,342.

# Finding Function From Data (Regression Method)

You will know when to use the regression method because the questions won't give you raw data on costs and drivers- they will instead give you a summary of that data:

<ImageMd img={img1} alt = ""/>

and you'll be like "omg what is all this stuff ???"

But don't you worry- this method is easier because the only thing you need are the three numbers highlighted.

The coefficient in <span style = "background-color:#61CBF3; padding:5px; border-radius:8px;">blue</span> is the y-intercept which we know is our 'a' and our fixed costs.

The coeffcient in <span style = "background-color:#D86DCD; padding:5px; border-radius:8px;">pink</span> is always the slope of whatever variable x you have. Also, in this case, your variable cost per unit.

The statisic in <span style = "background-color:#8ED973; padding:5px; border-radius:8px;">green</span> is the r<sup>2</sup> which tells you how good the summary data is. This comes in handy when they give you 2 summaries to make an equation and you have to figure out which one to use- which is the one with the bigger r<sup>2</sup>.

Everything else is irrelevant. So when doing these problems just ignore all the numbers except the ones highlighted.

In this case, our cost equation would be Y = <span style = "background-color:#61CBF3; padding:5px; border-radius:8px;">-0.84</span> + <span style = "background-color:#D86DCD; padding:5px; border-radius:8px;">2</span>X

What are the estimated costs if Sarai's company has inccured 1000 hours of assembly watches and needs to make 200 watches?

<li style="list-style:none">A) $44,890 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">B) $37,650 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">C) $24,940 </li>

<li style="list-style:none">D) $17,550 </li>

<Solution>

**Answer: D**

**Part 1**

You can make a equation out of both these results but the result you should always pick is the one with the highest r<sup>2</sup>

r<sup>2</sup> tells you how good the line fits to the data.

When you use assembly worker's hours as the variable that drives up or down your costs- r<sup>2</sup> is 0.74 meaning the numbers in this result fits the true data by 74% while if you use the number of watches as a cost driver the regression results only fit 43% of the data so we will use the regresion results that give us a more accurate estimation of costs and that is the one that fits the data more.

So the only thing you want is the 'a' and the 'b'. 'a' is always the constant coeffcient. Remember, it's fixed costs and fixed costs are constant, they don't change.

Your b or your variable cost per unit is always below it so that is $15.55.

Now, put your equation together to get:

Y = $2000 + $15.55x

and use it to answer the question.

**Part 2**

You have: Y = $2000 + $15.55x

What are the estimated costs if Sarai's company has inccured 1000 hours of assembly watches and needs to make 200 watches?

Since in Part 1 we chose the number of hours the workers worked to assemble the watches as our driver or our independent variable (X) then we need to choose the 'x' in the question that is the same 'x' as our driver.

So we won't plug in 200 watches into our equation because our equation's 'x' is not number of watches, it's number of assembly hours.

So we plug in 1000.

You have: Y = $2000 + $15.55(1000) = $17,550

</Solution>
