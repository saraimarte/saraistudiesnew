1.The first midterm is on CH2-Ch5 so no need to try hard on CH1

2.If you have Sahay, she does not allow graphing calculators, Fong doesn't care.

3.When you're asked to find the ending balance of an account, that is _not_ the same as finding the Ending Inventory of that account.

4.Inventoriable Costs is another way of saying Manufacturing Costs.

5.Overtime + Idletime = Indirect Labor Regular Time = Direct Labor

6.COGS is the same as TMC but TMC is not the same as COGS (sometimes??)

7.Sahay nor Fong take attendance.

8.Sahay's homeworks are SO much shorter than Fongs. Sahays are literally like 2-3 questions.

9.Sahay does not use lockdown browser for quizzes, Fong does.

10.Sahay actually shows how to do accounting (from scratch), Fong talks accounting (and reads off excels).

11.For the data analysis project, they don't give it to you until the end of the semester and once they grade it they don't tell you what's right or wrong. They just give you a grade.

12.Sahays Exams are literally the reviews. Literally. Fong's question choices are um hard.

13.Be careful with units, sometimes they'll ask you for yearly numbers but give you monthly numbers in the question.
