Company: Pencil Manufacture

Your company has a machine that was recently purchased with $5,000 and makes 5,000 pencils per month. It's depreciatied using straight line depreciation with 0 residual value over 5 years.
Your company currently produces and sells 4,000 pencils a month. Direct materials costs are 20 cents per pencil. Fixed manufacturing costs include rent for the wharehouse, other costs and totals $2,000 per month.

For this type of question identify your cost object.

Cost Object: Pencil.

Great, now just replace the word output in the question with the cost object.

"What is the annual relevant range of **pencils**?"

They're simply asking how many pencils you _can_ make in a year (_not_ how many you are currently making in a year.)

So, find how many pencils you have the _capacity_ of making in a year.

"Your company has a machine that was recently purchased with $7,000 and makes 5,000 pencils per month."

Well, we see that the machine we purchased has the capacity to make 5,000 pencils _per month_. But we want to know how many pencils it can make _per year_.

5000 pencils/month\* 12 months = **60,000 pencils.**

So, our annual relevant range of output is (0,60000) because we can make from 0 to 60,000 pencils per year (they also asked for a _range_, that's what a range is).

Okay! I love this question because I get to bring up the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell equivalent in managerial and that is...

For annual fixed manufacturing costs just go through the big 3.

DM are never fixed because they vary depending on how many units are produced.

DL also never fixed because the labor that goes into making the pencils vary depending on how many pencils you make.

OH can be both fixed (total cost of rent and depreciataion) and variable (total cost of cleaning supplies).

We are told "Fixed manufacturing costs include rent for the wharehouse, other costs and totals $2,000 per month."

The only fixed costs are OH costs (rent) and the other costs for a total of $2,000 _per month_, the question asks for annual fixed costs.

$2,000 FC/month \* 12 months = $24,000 FC/year

And now we have to add depreciation.

Depreciation is a fixed manufacturing OH cost because the amount that the machine deprecitates by does not change no matter how much you use it or do not use it.

The formula is cost of the machine - residual / year(s) = $5,000 - 0 residual / 5 years = $1,000 fixed depreciation.

So, total manufacturing fixed costs are $24,000 + $1,000 = **$25,000 FC /year.**

What about annual variable manufacturing costs?

Well, back to the big 3.

DM are variable because they vary depending on how many pencils are made.

DL costs are variable because they vary depending on how many pencils are made.

OH costs can be both variable and fixed.

We are told, "Direct materials costs are 20 cents per pencil."

We know we make 4,000 pencils a month.

So, .20 per pencil x 4,000 pencils per month = $800 DM cost per pencil per month \* 12 months = **$9,600 DM per pencil Annually.**

Because there is no mention of DL, DM is the only variable cost and so the current annual manufacturing varaible costs are $9,600.
