# Static Methods and Properties

Static is a property of the class, not of any specific object. A static method has no connection to the class and is its own entity. You could take a static method and put it in another class and it would work the same.

## Generic Classes

## Generic Static Methods 

If a static method needs to accept any kind of object, it needs to be made generic.

# Comparing for Inequality in Library Module 

# How to specify a T tpe with inequality method?

# How to specify that binarySearch expects ComparableT Type ObjectS?

# Abstract Method slide explicit interface 

public abstract comparable to blah 

# Properties of Interfaces

**1.** 
**2.** All fields in an interface have to be constants like pi in the Math class.

You can actually assign a method in the [...] class to be final that way you can't override any methods from the superclass?

# When to use class vs interface?

# Specialized Role for Classes


# Use case num 2 

# Polymorphism Using interface type 

(QHat you get when you get static dynmaic types but we will see this in the context of interfaces first)
