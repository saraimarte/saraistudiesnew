Object orientation means to create an instance of an object. 
Object orientation means to maintain a state.

Static is for non-object oriented programming 

# Example 1 | Suppose you want to write a program that just echoes whatever is typed in 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {`slide3`}/>

The Java Virtual Machine is what starts your program. But objects are created when programs start so how do you start a program and get it to run without any objects? 

Well that's where static comes in.

# Usage 2 | Static Methods for "Functions"

input -> function -> output 

A function has no memory of what happened once it's done executing => no "state" maintained between calls.

How is it that if we try to create an instance of a Math class...it won't let us? 

You write a constructor that does nothing and make it private so that no instances of <CS code = {`Math`}/> are created.

# Usage 3 | Static Fields for Constants  

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **utility class** is a one that contains only static or "utility" methods (or useful tools.)
</RuleBox>

In these classes they are always public static and final. 

Public because it's visible everywhere. 

Static because it's not a method belonging to a particular object. 

Final so no one can change it so it's safe that way. 

# Usage 4 | Static Fields for Sharing Among Instances  

Consider a class for which only a limited number of instances are allowed.

For instance, some kind of ecological simulation that populates a forest with tigers- want to put a llimit on number of tigers. 

Need to keep track of current count, IN THE TIGER CLASS.

Whenever an attempt is made to create a new tiger instance, a count... slide 9

Slide 10 insert code 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {`slide3`}/>

Point: Always use name of class the static methods belong to to call them. Instead of name of object because again the method doesn't belong to a specific object. 

# Global 

# Static/Non-static Mix: Another Example 

E.g. We want to parse a string into an integer. e.g. "123" -> 123 - where to provide this functionality?

Options:

**1.** Have a <CS code = {`String`}/> instance method, say, <CS code = {`parseAsInteger`}/> that returns an  <CS code = {`int`}/>, e.g. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {`int i = "123".parseInteger();`}/>

This is bad design. 

Why?

An instance method should be applicable to ALL instances. But not all strings are parsable as integers. 

You could have a String "abc123" that's not parsable as integers. 

Think of it like this: 

You have a <CS code = {`Stack`}/> class. 

With methods push, pop, etc. 

You have a <CS code = {`Queue`}/> class.

With methods enqueue, dequeue, etc. 

What if you had a class called <CS code = {`StackQueue`}/> with all of the methods of a <CS code = {`Stack`}/> and a <CS code = {`Queue`}/>?

That would be a mess because a user could use the enqueue method by accident but then it wouldn't  work! 

You want to ...

[Are these methods overloaded?]

## Implementing Equals as a Rookie 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {``}/>

Problem : 

Solution: 

## Implementing Equals in a smarter way. 


The Object class's equals(Object O)...

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {`public boolean equals(Point p){
return x ==}`}/>
