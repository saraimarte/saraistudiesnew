# Java Classes Review 

In CS111 we introduced the idea of wanting to model the real world. 

The real world is made up of objects like persons, animals, plants, pencils, etc. 

We learned how to create our own objects in Java and in this class it is assumed you are familiar with how to do so but if your'e not here is a review. 

**1. Start by creating a file <CS code = {`File.java`}/>**

**2. Write your boilerplate code (the classic file class and main method)**

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {
` public class File {

		public static void main(String[] args){

		}
		
   }
`}/>

From now on, any code we write should be placed inside the main method. 

**3. Create the class for the object**

Again, we can create any object from the real world, a person, a cat, a student, a point (x,y). The professor created a point so let's use that. 

Let's call that class <CS code = {`Point`}/>

Recall that a class is just a blueprint or a recipe- it tells Java how to create the object.


<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

` class Point{
			
	 }`}/>

**4. Define the attributes of the object**

Just like a person has attributes like name, eye color, DOB, etc. so does a point.

A classic coordinate point has two attributes- the two coordinate values - x and y.

Let's assume they are integers. 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

` class Point{
		int x,y; /*"hey, a Point should have values x and y" */
	 }`}/>

**5. Add a constructor**

<RuleBox>

**Def.** A **Constructor** is used to <Pop t = "give life/fill in/form">initialize</Pop> an object *not* <Pop t = "create">construct</Pop> an object.
</RuleBox>

In the same way that <CS code = {`int x;`}/> itself creates x (allocates memory for x) and <CS code = {`x = 2;`}/> afterwards initializes x to be 2, we have it so that <CS code = {`new`}/> creates the Point object but <CS code = {`new Point();`}/> initializes the Point to be what you want it to be.

Note that "creates x" means you simply reserved some space for this variable x and "creates the Point object" means you reserved some space for this object Point.

So you haven't told the variable or the object to come alive or to come to be. 

You're just saying "Hey, you exist. I know how much space you take up but I don't exactly know what you're made up of."

You haven't *initialized* them yet hence we use the constructor to initialize the object- to give life or an identity to the object.

Again, calling the constructor would look like this: <CS code = {`new Point();`}/>

This is the simplest constructor you can have- where there are no arguments being passed in. 

This is called a no-arg constructor. 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **no-arg constructor** is a constructor that has no arguments.
</RuleBox>

Now, if we used this constructor to initialize a new Point object, because it's a no-arg constructor, the user will not be able to pass any arguments or values in ... but we want the user to pass in what they want x and y to be! 

I mention this because you might be like "well <CS code = {`x = 2;`}/> and <CS code = {`new Point();`}/> don't look the same. Having x be 2 makes sense but what exactly are you having the Point be?"

So, we will get back to talking about no-arg constructors later but let's try to design a constructor where the user can actually pass in values for the Point. 

Again, we want the users to give the values for x and y when they initialize the object.

From the user's perspective, if they want to initialize a Point where x = 1 and y = 2, we want it to look like this: <CS code = {`new Point(1,2)`}/>

To design a constructor that allows you to do that, you would want to design it so that it takes in x and y as integers and assigns the value for x the user gave to the Point's x <Pop t = "instance variable">attribute</Pop> (and the same for y.)

The constructor would look something like this:

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {
`class Point{
	   int x,y;

	   /*Constructor*/

	   public Point (int x, int y){ /*It takes in two integer values x and y*/

			this.x = x;	/* It will assign the object's x to be the x the user puts in*/ 
			/*this.object'sX = user'sX;*/	

			this.y = y; /*and the same for y*/
		}
	}
`}/>

Recall, that <CS code = {`this.x`}/> refers to the object's x not the x that the user passes in.

**6. Create the object!**

Create and initialize an <Pop t = "version/copy">instance</Pop> of the Point Object <CS code = {`p`}/>so that it looks like this where x is 1 and y is 2.

Then, display the point created so that the output looks like this: <CS code = {`Point: (1,2)`}/> 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public static void main(String[] args){
	
	  class Point{
		int x,y;

		public Point (int x, int y){ 

			this.x = x;	

			this.y = y; 
		
		}

	  }

	Point p = new Point(1,2); /*make space for the object and create the object by calling the constructor*/
	System.out.println("Point: (" + p.x + "," + p.y + ")");	
}`}/>

Note that the constructor we designed in the <CS code = {`Point`}/> class requires two values so when you call the constructor you have to provide those two values.

In this case it was 1 and 2. 
 
Great! Now, you're up to speed and you're ready for Lecture 1's content:

Sesh started the class by deep diving into constructors. 


# Constructors 

Let's go back to where we left off on **step 4** before we added a constructor:

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

` class Point{
		int x,y; 
	 }`}/>

At the moment, we have only a class for an object Point and we have defined the attributes of the Point (those being it's x and y values.)

We have no constructor at the moment. 

## Sesh proposed the question: "Would this class compile without a constructor?" In other words is it necessary for you to write a constructor in order for the class to be 'valid'?

The answer is yes, this code would compile and no, it's not necessary for you to write a constructor for your classes.

Why? Because if you don't write a constructor the compiler will add one for you! 

The compiler adds what's called the default constructor. 

<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **default constructor** is a special type of no-arg constructor that is added to any class where the programmer did not add a constructor themselves. It's a no-arg constructor with nothing in the body (aka nothing in between the curly braces.)
</RuleBox>

So, if we compile the code above, the compiler will literally add a constructor to the code, so it would look like this: 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

` class Point{
		int x,y; 

		public Point(){} /*<-- Compiler Adds Default Constructor*/
	 }`}/>

Note that the compiler doesn't *literally* add the constructor to your file so that you can visually see your code change. It adds it while its compiling the code. 

So it's hidden to you but visible to the compiler during compilation.

## Sesh then proposed the question: "What happens if we try to create and initialize an <Pop t = "version/copy">instance</Pop> of the Point object?" In other words, what happens if we try to create a new object?

Well, the default constructor we know takes no arguments so it would look something like this, 

<CS code = {`new Point()`}/>

and if we do the same thing as before where we print the x and y values for the Point like so, 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public static void main(String[] args){
	
	  class Point{
		int x,y;
	  }

	Point p = new Point(); /*creates new Point Object- the compiler is using the default constructor since we didn't manually write one*/
	
	/*print out the point*/
	System.out.println("Point: (" + p.x + "," + p.y + ")");	
}`}/>

When we run this, we get Point: (0,0)

Interesting! 

You might be like, "Well, wait... I never told it that x and y should be 0"

and you're right! You didn't tell it to be 0.

Even if you wanted to tell it that x and y should be 0 you couldn't because we didn't design the Point object to have a constructor that allows users to assign values to x and y. 

So, who set the values of x and y to be 0...if it wasn't us?

The <CS code = {'new'}/> keyword did!

Not only does <CS code = {'new'}/> create the object by making space for it in memory but right after that, it assigns it a default value.

<CS code = {'new'}/> assigns default values for every <Pop t = "instance variable">attribute</Pop> defined in the object class. 

In this case, our defined attributes are the integers x and y so the <CS code = {'new'}/> keyword will assign the default integer value to x and y which is 0. 

Hence, why you see 0 for both x and y. 

If the attributes were objects, doubles, or other types, the default values would be different. For objects it would be null, for doubles it would be 0.0, for Strings it would be null etc. 

Note that it's not the constructor that sets the default values it's the <CS code = {'new'}/> keyword.

## Sesh then asked the question, "Would the following code compile?"

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public static void main(String[] args){
	
	  class Point{
		int x,y;
		public Point (int x, int y){ /* <--- CONSTRUCTOR */
				this.x = x;
				this.y = y;
		}
	  }

	Point p = new Point(); /*creates new Point Object*/
	
}`}/>

The answer is **no.**

Why?

You might be like "Wait, shouldn't it compile since if I didn't write the constructor the compiler would add a default constructor for me, right?"

Wrong :) 

Note that the compiler only adds the default constructor if you *fail* to add a constructor **at all.** 

Because you added a constructor, the compiler **will not** add the default constructor hence the only way you can create and construct a new Point object is to use the constructor in the object class above that looks like this:

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {
	`public Point (int x, int y){ /* <--- CONSTRUCTOR */
			this.x = x;
			this.y = y;
	}
`}/>

and as a user, you would call it like so: <CS code = {`new Point(1,2)`}/> where you are required to pass in a value of x and y. 

Now, let me propose this question: What if you wanted to change your object class so that you can create and construct a Point object like this: <CS code = {`new Point()`}/>? What would you need to do?

Well, you can have multiple constructors! Multiple ways of constructing an object. 

# Multiple Constructors and this()

You can design your object class so that it has several ways a user can create an <Pop t = "copy">instance</Pop> of that object. 

Again, if you want to construct a Point object without specifying any arguments given that you already have another constructor in your class, all you have to do is design the no-args constructor yourself and add it to the class.

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public static void main(String[] args){
	
	  class Point{
		int x,y;
		public Point (int x, int y){ /* <--- CONSTRUCTOR */
				this.x = x;
				this.y = y;
		}

		public Point (){ /* <--- 2nd CONSTRUCTOR (A No-Arg Constructor)*/
		
		}
	  }

	Point p = new Point(); /*creates new Point Object*/
	
}`}/>

Note that every default constructor is a no-arg constructor but not every no-arg constructor is a default constructor.

This is a perfect example, thee 2nd constructor we just added is a no-arg constructor but it looks exactly the same as a default constructor so is it a default constructor? No. 

A default constructor is one added only by the compiler. We manually added this no-arg constructor and in fact no-arg constructors can look different! 

For example, they can have stuff in the body! Default constructors can not.

What would be an a example of that?

Well, consider the case where you don't want the default values for x and y to be 0 and instead you want to define your own 'default' values. 

Note that at this point, these customized 'default' values are no longer default in the sense that the <CS code = {`new`}/> keyword assigned them but it's default in the sense that these are what you want your x and y to be, always.

As in, you don't want the user to be able to change them.

**E.g.** Let's say you want the values for x and y to be -1 always.

You would design a constructor that takes no arguments because you don't want the user to pass in any values for x and y since you want x and y to be -1 *always*. 

Hence, you would design a no-arg constructor. 

Additionally, in the body of the no-arg constructor you would set the object's x and y to be -1 like so: 

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

	`public Point (){ 
		this.x = -1;
		this.y = -1;
	}
`}/>

A shortcut to this which appeared on Sesh's slides is **only if you have the first constructor where you already wrote** <CS code = {`this.x = x; this.y = y`}/> then instead of being repetitive and writing it again in the no-arg constructor you can use this **this()** shortcut.

(You can use the this() shortcut in any constructor not just no-arg constructors.)

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

	`public Point (){ 
		this(-1,-1)
	}
	`}/>

The above code does the same thing as the previous code- it simply says "I want x and y to be -1 by default if the user uses this constructor."

**E.g.** Let's say you want the values for x to always be -1 but you want the user to be able to specify what y should be.


<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

	`public Point (int y){ 
		this(-1,y); /* this says let the object's x be -1 and let the object's y be the user's y . */
	}
	`}/>
