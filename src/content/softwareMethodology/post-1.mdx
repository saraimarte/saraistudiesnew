# Practice 

**1A.** What is the output for the following code?

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public class File {

	public static void main(String[] args){

		class Point{
		int x,y;

		public Point (int x, int y){
				this.x = x;
				this.y = y;
		}

		public Point (){ 
			this(-1,-1);
		}


	  }

	Point p = new Point(); 
	System.out.println("Point:(" + p.x + "," + p.y + ")");	}
}`}/>

**1B.** What would be the output if you changed <CS code = {`this(-1,-1)`}/> to <CS code = {`this(-1,0)`}/>
<Solution>

A. Point: (-1,-1) Here the default values for both x and y were set to be -1.

B. Point: (-1, 0) Here the default value for x was changed to be -1 and 0 for y.

</Solution>

**2.** Assume you have a constructor that lets the user construct a new point object by giving the values for both x and y. 
 
If you had to create another constructor that allowed the user to only input the x value and have the y value be a default value of -1, how would it look like?

<Solution>

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public class File {

	public static void main(String[] args){

		class Point{
		int x,y;
		
		public Point (int x, int y){
				this.x = x;
				this.y = y;
		}

		public Point (int x){ /*Requires that user inputs value for x*/
			this.x = x ; /*Sets Point's x to be user's x*/
			this.y = -1; /*Sets Point's y to be -1 by default*/
		}
	  }

	Point p = new Point(2);
	System.out.println("Point:(" + p.x + "," + p.y + ")");	}
}
`}/>

or you can use the this() shortcut instead of having to repeat this.x = x and this.y = y.

<Code lang = "java" fileName = "File.java" code = {

`public Point (int x){
		this(x,-1); /* Sets the Point's x to be user's inputted x value and y to be -1 by default.*/
	}`}/>

</Solution>
