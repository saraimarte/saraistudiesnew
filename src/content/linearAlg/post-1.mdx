# Motivation

 
Remember linear equations from algebra class? These equations represented lines. 

One problem we had in algebra was to find where 2 lines intersected.
 
**Recall:** A collection of linear equations is called a system of linear equations. 

So, the problem really was solving a system of equations because where two lines meet *is* the solution to a system of equations.

**Q:** How did we solve these systems before?
 
**A:** By using the substitution or elimination method.

What if I told you there is a faster way to solve these systems?

This way requires us to write the system in a different form- a matrix- so before anything else let's make sure we know how to do that. 

# Matrix Notation 
 
Every linear system can be represented by a matrix.

Let's practice rewriting systems as a matrix and cover some vocabulary.

# Transition from Matrix to Echelon Forms
 
Now that we're comfortable going from system to matrix let us consider this idea:

# Echelon Forms 

**Our ultimate goal is to get every matrix we work with into RREF because we'll be able to easily extract the solutions.**

However, on the way to RREF, we often stop at an intermediate form called Row Echelon Form (REF) as we discussed in the last video. 

Let's go over both forms, what they mean for the matrix and what they look like.

## Row Echelon Form (REF)

## Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)

Now that we know what a matrix in REF or RREF looks like, how do we actually get matrices to look like those forms?

There are algorithms (or recipes) we can follow which we will go over in an upcoming video.

But, just like any recipe we follow in real life, we need tools like utensils or pots and pans. 

So to follow these recipes we will need our own tools called elementary row operations.

## Elementary Row Operations

These are certain <s>actions</s> operations you can take on a matrix that *don't change the value* of the matrix- it simply changes the way it looks.

Before we use them, let's actually go over what they are.

Great! Now, that we know how to write a matrix, why we need to get it into REF or RREF form and what we need to do so (elementary row operations) we can go ahead and start.

# Many Solutions (+ Intro to Parametric Form)

# Practice 

Solve the following systems of equations.

<Problem n = "1">

<p>
x<sub>1</sub> + 5x<sub>2</sub> = 7  
x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = -2
</p>

</Problem>

<Solution>
**x<sub>1</sub> = -8  
x<sub>2</sub> =  3**
</Solution>

<Problem n = "2">
<p>
x<sub>1</sub> + 5x<sub>2</sub> = 7  
x<sub>1</sub> - 2x<sub>2</sub> = -2
</p>
</Problem>
<Solution>
**x<sub>1</sub> = 4/7   
x<sub>2</sub> = 9/7**  
</Solution>

<Problem n = "3">
<p>
x<sub>1</sub> + 3x<sub>2</sub> - 6x<sub>3</sub> + 6x<sub>4</sub> = 4  
3x<sub>1</sub> + -7x<sub>2</sub> + 8x<sub>3</sub> - 5x<sub>4</sub> = 8  
3x<sub>1</sub> + -8x<sub>2</sub> +  10x<sub>3</sub> - 9x<sub>4</sub> = 9  

</p>
</Problem>
<Solution>

<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 3  & -6  & 6  & 4 \\
3 & -7 & 8  & -5 & 8 \\
3 & -8 & 10 & -9 & 9 \\
\end{bmatrix}"/>


X<sub>1</sub> = 167/18 - 2**x<sub>3</sub>**  
x<sub>2</sub> = 11/3 + 2**x<sub>3</sub>**  
x<sub>3</sub> = **x<sub>3</sub>**    
x<sub>4</sub> = -7/6 

Recall:**x<sub>3</sub> is a free variable** since it is **not** a pivot column. That means we need to put our solutions in terms of x<sub>3</sub> aka **have every variable equal to something involving x<sub>3</sub> except variables who's solutions are constants like x<sub>4</sub>**.

</Solution>

For the following problems, the augmented matricies of a linear system have been reduced to the form shown below. For each of the problems, continue the row operations if possible and describe the solution set of the their respective original systems. 

<Problem n = "4">

<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 7  & 3  & -4 \\
0 & 1  & -1 & 3  \\
0 & 0  & 1  & 0  \\
0 & 0  & 1  & -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}"/>

</Problem>
<Solution>

**No Solution.** 

You can see it once you get to REF(A) that 0 = 1 and that is not true. Anytime you see something that is not true **once in REF** then that means there is no solution to the system. 

</Solution>

<Problem n = "5">

<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0  & 0  & 1 \\
1 & 0  & 5  & 9 \\
7 & 0  & 0  & -7 \\
\end{bmatrix}"/>

</Problem>
<Solution>

Notice, it's already in REF so just make it RREF form. 

**x<sub>1</sub> = -4     
x<sub>2</sub> = 9   
x<sub>3</sub> = -1** 
</Solution>

For the following problems, determine an equation involving g, h, and k that makes the following augmented matricies the augmented matricies of a consistent system.

<Problem n = "6">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix}
1  & -2 & 5  & g \\
0  & 2  & -3 & h \\
-3 & 5  & -9 & k \\
\end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

<Solution>

**2h + 3g + k = 0**

In other words, for this system to have a solution, 2h + 3g + k needs to be 0. If not, we will have 0 = n where n is some nonzero number and *that* is not true so it would be no solution.
</Solution>

<Problem n = "7">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix}
1  & -4 & 7  & g \\
0  & 3  & -5 & h \\
-2 & 5  & -9 & k \\
\end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

<Solution>
**k + 2g + h = 0** 

For the same reasons as problem 6.
</Solution>

Choose h and k so that the system has (a) no solution, (b) unique solution, (c) many solutions.
<Problem n = "8">
<p>
x<sub>1</sub> + hx<sub>2</sub> = 2  
4x<sub>1</sub> + 8x<sub>2</sub> = k
</p>
</Problem>

<Solution>
**No Solution:** h = 2 k ≠ 8   
**Unique Solution:** h ≠ 2  
**Many Solution:** h = 2 k = 8

Here you have to use the defintion of a system of linear equation that is:  
a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> = c<sub>1</sub>  
a<sub>2</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> = c<sub>2</sub>  

and it's following properties: 

For **No Solution:** the following has to be true:

a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub>x<sub>1</sub> =  b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>/b<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> ≠ c<sub>1</sub>/c<sub>2</sub>  

For **Unique Solution:** the following has to be true:

a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub>x<sub>1</sub> ≠  b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>/b<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> 

For **Many Solutions:** the following has to be true:

a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub>x<sub>1</sub> =  b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>/b<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> = c<sub>1</sub>/c<sub>2</sub>  

</Solution>

<Problem n = "9">
<p>A system of linear equations with fewer equations than unknowns is sometimes called an underdetermined system. Say that the system is consistent. Why must there be an infinite number of solutions?</p>
</Problem>

<Solution>
If there are not enough equations to solve for the unknowns then that means there must be a free variable that most of those unknowns will depend on. That free variable is *free* to be anything we want it to be so there will be infinitely many solutions.
</Solution>
