# Motivation

<F>
One problem we had in algebra was to find where 2 lines intersected.
</F>

Where to lines meet is what we called the solution to a system(collection) of linear equations. 

<F>
**Q:** How did we solve these systems before?
</F>

<F>
**A:** By using the substitution or elimination method.
</F>

What if I told you there is a faster way to solve these systems?

This way requires us to write the system in a different form- a matrix- so before anything else let's make sure we know how to do that. 

# Matrix Notation  

<F>
Every linear system can be represented by a matrix.
</F>

<F>
Let's practice rewriting systems using matrix notation. 
</F>

<F>
Now that we're comfortable going from system -> matrix let us consider this idea:
</F>

<F>
Imagine you have a matrix where all the entries in a row are zero except for one entry that is 1.
</F>

<Latex formula = '\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & | & 2 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & | & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}'/>

When we translate this matrix back into it's system we get this:

<Latex formula = "\begin{aligned}
1x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 &= 1 \\
0x_1 + 1x_2 + 0x_3 &= 2 \\
0x_1 + 0x_2 + 1x_3 &= 3
\end{aligned}
"/>

and if we simplify and remove all jargon we get:

<Latex formula = "\begin{aligned}
    x_1 = 1 \\
    x_2 = 2 \\
    x_3 = 3
\end{aligned}
"/>

So, what does this tell me? I want to get my matrix into a form where I have one 1 in each row (with zeros everywhere else in that row), or as close as possible to that form, so I can easily find the solutions to my system!

Now, there is a name for that form. It's called reduced row echelon form (RREF.)

# Row Echelon Form (REF) and Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)

**Our ultimate goal is to get every matrix we work with into RREF because we'll be able to easily extract the solutions.**

However, on the way to RREF, we often stop at an intermediate form called Row Echelon Form (REF).

You might be wondering, what's the point of learning REF if our goal is to get the matrix into RREF?

**Why stop at REF?**

**(1) RREF builds on REF:** Both forms follow similar rules, so understanding REF helps us get to RREF.

**(2) Saves time:** Not all systems have solutions (like when two lines don’t intersect). REF helps us determine if there’s no solution early on. If we see a situation where the system has no solution, we can stop at REF and avoid wasting time continuing to RREF. But, if there is a solution, we can keep going to RREF to get the exact answer.

Let's go over both forms, what they mean for the matrix and what they look like.

* talk about case scenerios once you get to RREF either unique solution so every variable has a unique solution or some variables have many solutions. 
Those are your only two case scenarios with RREF because you would have already figured out if it had no solution while on your way to RREF while in REF

Now that we're familiar with REF and RREF and know that our goal is to get the matrix in that form, the question is: How can I get the matrix in those forms? I know what it needs to have but how do I get to that?

# Elementary Row Operations.

These are certain actions you can take on a matrix that *don't change the value* of the matrix- it simply changes the way it looks.

We can use Elementary row operations to get our matrix to look like REF/RREF Form without changing the value of the matrix itself.

Before we use them, let's actually go over what they are.

Great! Now, that we know how to write a matrix, why we need to get it into REF or RREF form and what we need to do so (elementary row operations) we can go ahead and start. 


But first a note: 

Remember when I said that our goal is to get any matrix in a form where there is one 1 entry in a row and everything else is zero (meaning system has unique solutions for every variable) or something close to that (meaning system has many solutions for some variables)?

When you're dealing with a system there are only three possible outcomes either you have a unique solution, so each variable is a fixed value or infinitely many solutions meaning some variables will be written in terms of others, or no solution. 

What I want to make clear is that when you're done getting your matrix in RREF form just because a row does not have all zeros except for 1 entry, it does not mean it's not in RREF or that there aren't any solutions. When that happens that means the system has *many* solutions for each variable. You just have to describe the solutions parametrically.

**These Gaussian Eliminations are just a faster and more organized way of solving systems.**

In other words, performing Gauss-Jordan Elimination will get us RREF(A). Here matrix is reduced completely - as much as it can be. You can either see the solution straight forward or put the solution in terms of free variables (more on that in the video.)

Performing just Gauss Elimination/row reduction will get us REF(A) where the matrix is reduced a bit but not completely.

Let's do our first example. This example will also cover a discussion about solutions at the end.
