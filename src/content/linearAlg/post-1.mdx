# Matrix Notation  

Let's start with a system of equations. 

x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> = 3

2x<sub>1</sub> + 5<sub>2</sub> = 9

Fact: Every linear system can be represented by a matrix- specifically an augmented matrix.

How can we write that in matrix notation?

Just take the coefficients and write them in order and then for the sums put those after a line. 

# Solving Systems  of Equations Using the Matrix 

There is an algorithm—or for those of you who aren't computer science folks, a recipe—that we can follow to solve systems of equations using matrices.
