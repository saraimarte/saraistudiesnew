# Motivation

<F>
**Recall:** Linear Equations like x + 3 = 4 (b/c x has exponent of 1.)
</F>

<F>
NOT x<sup><b>2</b></sup> + 2 =0 (b/c of the exponent of 2.)
</F>

<F>
**Recall:** A collection of linear equations is called a system of linear equations. 
</F>

<F>
One problem we had in algebra was to find where 2 lines intersected.
</F>

<F>
We call this intersection the solution to the system.
</F>

# Let's talk about solutions

<F>
Recall: When we're solving a system we're just finding **where these lines intersect.** 
</F>

<F>
**1.** If the systems have **no solutions** then that means **they don't intersect**. 
</F>

<F>
Think: How in the world wide web can two lines not intersect? 
</F>

<F> 
If they are parallel. 
</F>

<F>
So, if a system has no solution then they never intersect hence the lines have to be parallel.
</F>

<F>
**2.** If the systems have **one solution** then that means **they do intersect at one point**.
</F>

<F>
**3.** If the systems have **many solutions** then that means **they do intersect at every point**.
</F>

<F>
Think: How in the world wide web can two lines intersect at the same points?
</F>

<F> 
If they are the same lines. 
</F>

<F>
So, if a system has infinitely many solutions then they intersect at all the same points hence the lines have to be the same.
</F>

# Back to Systems

<F>
**Q:** How did we solve systems?
</F>

<F>
**A:** We either used the substitution or elimination method.
</F>

<F>
What if I told you there is a faster way to do it?
</F>

<F>
It's not a new method but a new form to write a system.
</F>

<F>
Writing systems in this form can help us solve systems faster with the methods we already have.
</F>

<F>
This new form is called matrix notation.
</F>

# Matrix Notation  

<F>
Fact: Every linear system can be represented by a matrix.
</F>

<F>
Let's practice rewriting systems using matrix notation. 
</F>

# Solving Systems of Equations Using the Matrix 

## REF and RREF
<F>
There is an algorithm—or for those of you who aren't computer science folks, a recipe—that we can follow to solve systems of equations using matrices.
</F>

<F>
The recipe consists of getting the matrix into Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) but to do that you need to get it in row echelon form first (REF.) 
</F>

<F>
Let's go over what each form means.
</F>

Now, we know what REF and RREF look like but how do we get to it?
