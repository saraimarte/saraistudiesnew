# Motivation

<F>
Remember linear equations like y = x + 2 or y = 2x + 2
</F> 

<F>
One problem we had in algebra was to find where 2 of these lines intersected.
</F>

<F>
**Recall:** A collection of linear equations is called a system of linear equations. 
</F>

So, the problem really was solving a system of equations because where two lines meet is the solution to a system of equations.

<F>
**Q:** How did we solve these systems before?
</F>

<F>
**A:** By using the substitution or elimination method.
</F>

What if I told you there is a faster way to solve these systems?

This way requires us to write the system in a different form- a matrix- so before anything else let's make sure we know how to do that. 

# Matrix Notation  

<F>
Every linear system can be represented by a matrix.
</F>

<F>
Let's practice rewriting systems using matrix notation. 
</F>

Now that we're comfortable going from system -> matrix let us consider this idea:

Imagine you have a matrix where all the entries in a row are zero except for one 1 entry that is 1.

<Latex formula = '\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & | & 2 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & | & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}'/>

When we translate this matrix back into it's system we get this:

<Latex formula = "\begin{aligned}
1x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 &= 1 \\
0x_1 + 1x_2 + 0x_3 &= 2 \\
0x_1 + 0x_2 + 1x_3 &= 3
\end{aligned}
"/>

and if we simplify and remove all jargon we get:

<Latex formula = "\begin{aligned}
    x_1 = 1 \\
    x_2 = 2 \\
    x_3 = 3
\end{aligned}
"/>

So, what does this tell me? I want to get my matrix into a form where I have one 1 in each row (with zeros everywhere else in that row), or as close as possible to that form, so I can easily find the solutions to my system!

Now, there is a name for that form it's called reduced row echelon form (RREF.)

In fact, our ultimate goal is to get every matrix we work with into RREF because it makes solving systems of equations simple and straightforward.

However, on the way to RREF, we often stop at an intermediate form called Row Echelon Form (REF).

You might be wondering, what's the point of learning REF if our goal is to get the matrix into RREF?

**Why stop at REF?**

**(1) RREF builds on REF:** Both forms follow similar rules, so understanding REF helps us get to RREF.

**(2) Saves time:** Not all systems have solutions (like when two lines don’t intersect). REF helps us determine if there’s no solution early on. If we see a situation where the system has no solution, we can stop at REF and avoid wasting time continuing to RREF. But, if there is a solution, we can keep going to RREF to get the exact answer.
