**Def.**

Let S be a nonempty set of vectors u<sub>1</sub> to u<sub>n</sub> in R<sup>n</sup>. 

S is linearly independent if the only scalars that will combine with the vectors in that set to give us 0 are all 0.

In other words, the vectors don't depend on eachother and we can't combine them together with scalars to give us 0 so they are independent vectors.
