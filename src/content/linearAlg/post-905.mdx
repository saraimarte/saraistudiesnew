# Finding Basis of Column, Row, and Null Spaces 

In this video, we’re going to work on finding the basis for the column space, row space, and null space of a matrix. We’ll start with what you already know—how to get sets for Col(A), Row(A), and Null(A)—and then go through how to find the basis for each of those spaces.

# Is a Given Set a Basis? | Transforming Sets into Basis

<Rulebox>
A **basis** is a set of linearly independent vectors. To check if a set is a basis, put those vectors as columns in a matrix. Then, get the matrix into Row Echelon Form (REF). If it’s a basis, there should be a pivot in every column and row.

It should also have the right amount of vectors/columns. If a set is a basis for R<sup>3</sup> then the set should only have 3 vectors. No more no less.

In the next video, we’ll look at how to tell if a set of vectors forms a basis in a certain space. And if it doesn’t, I’ll show you how to turn that set into a basis.
