# Vocab 

**1. Square Matrix** is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns. For example, 

<Latex formula = "\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 1 \\ 
7 & 4 
\end{bmatrix} \text{ with dimensions } (2 \times 2)"/>

Here, rows = 2, cols = 2.

**2. Transpose** of any matrix is that same matrix but with rows and columns switched (so dimensions/size switch.)

We call the transpose of matrix A, A<sup>T</sup>.

For example, the transpose of the following matrix A,

<Latex formula = "\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 
\textcolor{blue}{\mathbf{2}} & \textcolor{blue}{\mathbf{1}} \\ 
7 & 4 \\ 
5 & 9 
\end{bmatrix}, \text{ with dimensions } (3 \times 2)"/>

is 

<Latex formula = "\mathbf{A^T} = \begin{bmatrix} 
\textcolor{blue}{\mathbf{2}} & 7 & 5 \\ 
\textcolor{blue}{\mathbf{1}} & 4 & 9 
\end{bmatrix}, \text{ with dimensions } (2 \times 3)"/>

We just take every row in matrix A and make it a column in matrix A<sup>T</sup>.

# Matrix Operations 

Before doing operations you want to save time by checking if you *can* do them in the first place. In other words if the operations are defined. 

To know what is defined and what is not, here are the following rules:

**Rule 1:** When you're adding or subtracting matricies, they have to have the same dimensions and it will result in a matrix with the same dimensions.  

**Rule 2:** When you're multiplying matricies, the columns of the first matrix has to be equal to the rows of the second matrix. This will result in a matrix with the number of rows of the first matrix and number of columns of the second matrix. 









For example, let A, B and C be matricies with the following sizes:

A (3 x 4) and B (4 x 2) and C (4 x 2)

Can we do B + C? Yes, because they both have (4 x 2) dimensions. 

Can we do A + B? No, because they have different dimensions.

**Rule:** When you're multiplying matricies, the columns of the first matrix has to be equal to the rows of the second matrix. This will result in a matrix with the number of rows of the first matrix and number of columns of the second matrix. 

Can we do AB?

Yes, because **number of columns = number of rows** 

A (3 x **4**) and B (**4** x 2) this will result in a (3 x 2) matrix. **4 = 4**

Can we do A<sup>T</sup>B?

**Recall:** Transpose means just make rows the columns. That means dimensions switch.

A<sup>T</sup> is (4 x 3) can we multiply that by B now? No. Because number of columns is not the same as number of rows. This operation is undefined. 

A<sup>T</sup> (4 x **3**)  B (**4** x 2)  **3 â‰  4**
