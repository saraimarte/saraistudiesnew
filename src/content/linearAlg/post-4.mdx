In this lesson, we will be learning how to multiply matricies (A) and vectors (**x**) together to give us another vector **b**.

Hence A â€¢ **x** = A**x**=**b**

Compute the following products. 

<Problem n = "1">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 3 & 1 \\ 5 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

<Problem n = "2">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

Sometimes you will be given a matrix and the result but not the vector. You will have to find the vector.

<Latex formula = "A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & 5 \\ -2 & -4 & -3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}"/>

Finally, you will be asked to find the solution (what the vector is) when vector **b** is equal to 0. 

In other words, you have to learn how to solve for A**x** = **b**.

Describe all solutions to A**x** = 0.

<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & -4 & -2 & 0 & 3 & -5 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}"/>
