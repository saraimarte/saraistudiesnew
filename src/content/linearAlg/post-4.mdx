# From Vectors to the Matrix Equation 

In the previous lesson, we explored how combining vectors with scalar multiples results in new vectors. We can call one of those combinations or one of those vectors **ùëè**. 

In other words, **ùëè** can be expressed as a linear combination of those vectors and their scalars, C:

**ùëè** = C<sub>1</sub>**V<sub>1</sub>**  +  C<sub>2</sub>**V<sub>2</sub>**

What‚Äôs new is that b can also be represented as the product of a matrix and a vector:

**ùëè** = A**ùë•**

Here, b is simply the result of multiplying a matrix of coefficients by a vector.

# How do we go from **ùëè** = C<sub>1</sub>**V<sub>1</sub>**  +  C<sub>2</sub>**V<sub>2</sub>** to **ùëè** = A**ùë•**

Let's try to make the connection from systems of equations to vectors and then from vectors to the matrix equation. 

In the last lesson we learned that a **vector is just a list of numbers**. 

Now, take this system of equations, 

<Latex formula="
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 = -2 \\
"/>

What are we trying to solve for here? x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>

In other words, we have a list of unkown numbers x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> which we need to solve for. 

But what else is a list of numbers? A vector!

This perspective reveals that whenever we solved a system of equations in 1.1/1.2, we were, in fact, solving for a vector‚Äîa list of unknown numbers!

We can have x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> be components- the unknowns- of a vector **x** like so,

<Latex formula = "\overline{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} \\ \textcolor{blue}{x_2} \end{bmatrix}" />

With this understanding, we can now introduce a more efficient way-or form- to express systems of equations: the matrix equation. Before diving into the matrix equation, let‚Äôs recall the forms we have been using:

**1.** We can write the system as an augmented matrix. 

**2.** We can write the system in column vector form. 

**3.** Now, we can write the system as a matrix equation where we have a list (vector) of unknowns!

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
    <Latex formula="
    \begin{array}{c}
    \textcolor{red}{x_1} + 5\textcolor{blue}{x_2} = 7 \\
    \textcolor{red}{x_1} - 2\textcolor{blue}{x_2} = -2 \\
    \\
    \downarrow \\
    \text{Augmented Matrix} \\
    \\
    \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 & \vert & 7 \\ 1 & -2 & \vert & -2 \end{bmatrix} \\
    \\
    \downarrow \\
    \text{Vector Form} \\
    \\
    \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} + \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \textcolor{blue}{x_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \\
    \\
    \downarrow \\
    \text{Matrix Equation} \\
    \\
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A} 
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} \\ \textcolor{blue}{x_2} \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{x}} = 
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{b}}
    \end{array}" />
</div>

But now, we get the idea of system of equations -> vector -> matrix eqution but how do we ‚ú®literally‚ú® or mathematically go from vector form to matrix equation?  [insert video]

Well, through the rules we learned about scalar multiplicationn and vector addition [insert video.]

We can further emphasize the idea of this being an equation by having something be missing, then we can solve for it.

**1.** Solving for **x** when A and **b** are given. 

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
    <Latex formula="
    \begin{array}{c}
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A} 
    \vec{x} = 
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{b}}
    \end{array}" />
</div>

This is the problem we have above, we are trying to find these unknown components given the matrix A and the resulting vector **b**. 

This, is ‚ú®literally‚ú®, you guessed it, just an augmented matrix [A|b] because... you know... your given A and **b**, so to find the unknown values x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> aka the solutions, just put the coefficient matrix in RREF. 

**2.** Solving for **b** when A and **x** are given.

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
    <Latex formula="
    \begin{array}{c}
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A} 
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{4/7} \\ \textcolor{blue}{9/7} \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{x}} = \vec{b}
    \end{array}" />
</div>

This is easier because all you have to do is multiply a matrix and a vector which I will show you how to do.

**3.** Solving for **x** when A and **b** are given but **b** is the 0 vector.

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
    <Latex formula="
    \begin{array}{c}
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A} 
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} \\ \textcolor{blue}{x_2} \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{x}} = 
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{0}}
    \end{array}" />
</div>


# Practice

Find the vector **x** that was multiplied by A to get **b**. 

<Problem n = "1">
<Latex formula = "A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & 5 \\ -2 & -4 & -3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

Compute the following products (Find **b**)

<Problem n = "2">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 3 & 1 \\ 5 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

<Problem n = "3">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

Describe all solutions to A**x** = 0.

<Problem n = "4">

0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \\

\end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>
