Recall that a **vector** is just a list of numbers. 

Recall when we were solving systems of equations we were solving for unknown list of numbers. 

Take this system of equations, 

<p>
x<sub>1</sub> + 5x<sub>2</sub> = 7  
x<sub>1</sub> - 2x<sub>2</sub> = -2
</p>

What are we trying to solve for here? x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>

In other words, we have a list of unkown numbers (or variables) which we need to solve for. 

But what else is a list of numbers? A vector!

So, we can reframe this as everytime we solved a system of equations we were really solving for a vector- a list of unknown numbers like so,

<Latex formula = "\overline{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} \\ \textcolor{blue}{x_2} \end{bmatrix}" />

Which introduces the need for a new form of writing systems (yay!)

First, let's recall the forms we have right now.

**1.** We can write the system as an augmented matrix. 

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
<Latex formula="\begin{array}{c}
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 = -2 \\
\downarrow \\
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 5 & 7 \\
1 & -2 & -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}" />
</div>

**2.** We can write the system in column vector form. 

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
<Latex formula="\begin{array}{c}
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 = -2 \\
\downarrow \\
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} + \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \textcolor{blue}{x_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}
\end{array}" />
</div>

**3.** Now, we can write the system as a matrix equation!

<div style="display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
<Latex formula="\begin{array}{c}
x_1 + 5x_2 = 7 \\
x_1 - 2x_2 = -2 \\
\downarrow \\
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A} \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{x_1} \\ \textcolor{blue}{x_2} \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{x}} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{b}}
\end{array}" />
</div>

Then, we can rewrite it as such where our vector is now the column of unknown variables. This is called the matrix equation. 

where we are solving for a vector **x** which represents a list of unknowns, 

<Latex formula="
\begin{array}{c}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\ 1 & -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A} \vec{x} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}}_{\vec{b}}
\end{array}" />

and where your A is your coefficient matrix and **b** is another vector that we *know* the values of!

In this lesson, we will be solving for vector **x** as we spent all of 1.1 and 1.2 doing **and** we will be learning how to multiply matricies (A) and vectors (**x**) together to give us another vector **b**.

Hence A â€¢ **x** = A**x**=**b**

Compute the following products. 

<Problem n = "1">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 3 & 1 \\ 5 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

<Problem n = "2">
<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}"/>
</Problem>

Sometimes you will be given a matrix and the result but not the vector. You will have to find the vector.

<Latex formula = "A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & 5 \\ -2 & -4 & -3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}"/>

Finally, you will be asked to find the solution (what the vector is) when vector **b** is equal to 0. 

In other words, you have to learn how to solve for A**x** = **b**.

Describe all solutions to A**x** = 0.

<Latex formula = "\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & -4 & -2 & 0 & 3 & -5 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}"/>
