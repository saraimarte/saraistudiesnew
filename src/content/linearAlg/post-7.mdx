In this lesson, we will learn how to transform vectors to another dimension (or the same)!

All we're doing is taking any vector **x** and transforming it so it turns to T(**x**).

How do we transform it?

We multiply by a matrtix like so A**x**.

This matrix acts on the vector to transform it into T(**x**) read as the transformed version of vector **x**. 

Sometimes, your given what we would like the transformation to be and you need to solve for what the martix should be in order to transform **x** to T(**x**).

Think of T as a function! It takes in something and outputs something else.

In this case, it takes in vector **x** and outputs the transformed version of vector **x** or in other words the **image** of **x**. 

# Solve for the Image T(x)

<Latex formula = "Let  \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}. \text{ Find the images under T of the vector } \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix}."/>

# Solve for the Vector x

Find a vector **x** whose image under T is **b**, and determine whether **x** is unique. 

<Latex formula = "\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & -4 \\ 3 & -5 & -9 \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ -9 \end{bmatrix}."/>
