Before, we looked at systems of equations from the point of view of a **matrix**.

Now, we will look at systems from the point of view of a **vector**.

What is a vector?

A **vector** is a special type of matrix. Simply, it is a matrix with one row or one column. 

Something special about the matrix is that we can visualize it.

For example take <Latex formula = "\overline{\textcolor{purple}{\mathbf{v}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{1} \\ \textcolor{green}{2} \end{bmatrix}"/>

The way you can plot this is by thinking of the first entry of how far right you should go and the bottom how far up you should go. 

<ImageMd img = {img1} alt = "Vector V"/>

Now what's interesting is that you can multiply this vector by any number we call C. That will *scale* each entry. 

Let's say I want to make the vector twice as long...then I will just multiply the vector by 2!

<Latex formula = "2 \overline{\textcolor{purple}{\mathbf{v}}} = 2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{1} \\ \textcolor{green}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \cdot \textcolor{red}{1} \\ 2 \cdot \textcolor{green}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{2} \\ \textcolor{green}{4} \end{bmatrix}"/>

<ImageMd img = {img3} alt = "Vector 2V"/>

Now, you can see 2 times the vector in orange. Literally. You can see that the orange vector is just 2 of the pink vectors. 

This is what we call scaling. We scaled vector **v** to be *twice* as big and that vector became 

<Latex formula = "2 \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} \textcolor{red}{2} \\ \textcolor{green}{4} \end{bmatrix}"/>

So, we can say that this vector **2v** is a combination of the vector **v** and it's scalar(s) in this case 2. 

Let's say we want to add two vectors together and scale them. 

Notice, we can have our scalar be anything. I can scale vector **v** to be thrice as big, four times as big, five times as big and so on. 

In other words, there are infinitely many combinations I can make with vector **v** to give me different vectors. 

The collection of all vectors that are linear combinations of vector **v** and it's scalar is called the **span** of vector **v**. 

So when we ask is vector **b** in the span of vector **v** and it's scalars, we're really asking if vector **b** is a linear combination of vector **v** and it's scalars. 

In other words, it's equivalent to asking the question "is vector **b** a solution to the system of equations derived from the combination of vectors and scalars?"

Take the following system: 

3x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> = 7  
x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4

When we were going from system to matrix, the matrix would look like so:

<div style = "display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
<Latex formula = "\begin{array}{c}
3x_1 + x_2 = 7 \\
x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 \\
\downarrow \\
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 & 7 \\
1 & 2 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}"/>
</div>

<br/>
Now, we go from system to column vector form. 
<br/>
<div style = "display:flex; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
<Latex formula = "\begin{array}{c}
3x_1 + x_2 = 7 \\
x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 \\
\downarrow \\
\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} x_1 + \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} x_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
\end{array}"/>
</div>

See, it's simply another way to write the system. This time, we are just treating the coefficients that were going to end up as columns in the matrix as...vectors. 

Given that this is the general form of a linear equation where a<sub>1</sub>... a<sub>n</sub> are coefficients (that are real numbers) and  x<sub>1</sub>... x<sub>n</sub> are variables. 

<Latex formula = "a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n = b"/>

Now, all the a values are put together in an ƒÅ vector. 

<Latex formula = "\textcolor{blue}{y} = c_1 \textcolor{blue}{v_1} + \cdots + c_p \textcolor{blue}{v_p}"/>
