Up until now, we've been plotting points on ℝ², which is the same coordinate plane you've been using since 8th grade.

Just as a coordinate point (x₁, x₂) is a pair or *list* of numbers, a vector is also a list of numbers. Another way to represent points on a graph is through vectors.

See how I do so in the following video,

Now, let's practice adding, subtracting and scaling vectors (aka multiplying by any real number *c*.)

We learned above that we can add vectors together and not only can we add them, but we can also scale them before adding.

This gives us countless combinations, each resulting in different vectors. So the question becomes: given any vector, can we determine if it is a linear combination of two other vectors that have been added and possibly scaled?

Note that all the possible linear combinations (all possible resulting vectors) of two vectors is called the **span** of those two vectors.

Let's see if we can answer that question but before, here is a quick lesson on how to write systems in a new form-column vector form!

# Example 1

# Example 2

Now, we know how to check if a vector is a linear combination of other vectors. 

If you have two vectors, multiplying them by any scalars gives infinitely many possible combinations. 

The set of all these combinations is called the **span** of the two vectors. 

So, asking if vector b is a linear combination of two vectors is the same as asking if it's in their span.

Let's see an example of such question.
