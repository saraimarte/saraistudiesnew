# Vectors 

Up until now, we've been plotting points on ℝ², which is the same coordinate plane you've been using since 8th grade.

Just as a coordinate point (x₁, x₂) is a pair or *list* of numbers, a vector is also a list of numbers. Another way to represent points on a graph is through vectors.

See how I do so in the following video,

## Vector Operations 

Now, let's practice adding, subtracting and scaling vectors (aka multiplying by any real number *c*.)

# Transition From The Idea That We Can Scale and Add/Combine Vectors to Linear Combinations of Vectors

Either watch the video below or if your in a hurry, just read the text below it.

We learned in the previous video that we can add vectors together and not only can we add them, but we can also scale them before adding.

This gives us countless combinations of new vectors. So the question becomes: given any vector, can we determine if it is one of the combinations - specifically linear combinations- of two other vectors that have been added and possibly scaled?

Answering the question above is what I call an application of the skills we learned in 1.1 and 1.2.

Let's see if we can answer that question but before, here is a quick lesson on how to write systems in a new form-column vector form!

# Application 1| Is a given vector a combination of two other vectors and their scalars c?

## Example 1

## Example 2

# Application 2| Is a given vector in the span of two other vectors?

Now, we know how to check if a vector is a linear combination of other vectors. 

If you have two vectors, multiplying them by any scalars gives infinitely many possible combinations. 

The set of all these combinations is called the **span** of the two vectors. 

So, asking if vector b is a linear combination of two vectors is the same as asking if it's in their span.

Let's see an example of such question.
