# Investment Companies 

Investment companies are the middlemen between the firms and savers. They act as financial intermediaries. 

They pool money from savers and invest in a diversified portfolio of securities.

Mutual funds 

## Key functions 

**1. Record Keeping:** the assets that may be contained in the fund may be a couple of bonds/stocks. They have to keep track of how many shares each investor has, who owns each share, etc. 

**2. Diversification:** They invest in a whole bunch of different companies weather its common stock or bonds. 

**3. Professional Management:** This fund is run by managers. Their job is to figure out when to buy or when to sell. 

**4. Lower Transaction Costs:** They buy in bulk, in volume so they can usually get lower transaction costs. 

**5. NAV (Net Asset Value):** is how much each share is worth. (E.g. If you have a 1000 shares of XYZ mutual fund and each share is $10 then 1000($10) gives you the value of your investment.)

## Types of Investment Companies

**1. Unit investment trusts:** They are fixed portfolios. As in, money from the investors goes into a mutual fund but the fund doesn't change. (E.g. A high-tech stock mutual fund will always have the same tech related stocks no matter what. Like Facebook, Tesla, Amazon, etc.) If there are 100 companies, there always will be 100 companies. 

**2. Open-end funds** The fund will always be issuing new shares. You buy a share from the fund, if you want to sell it you have to sell it back to the fund. Even if the fund is not performing well, they will still buy back your shares. 

**3. Closed-end funds** The fund will only issue a certain amount of shares. If you want to sell your shares, you will have to sell it on your own in the market place.  

**4. Commingled funds:** You have a bunch of different investors and they all pool their money together.

**5. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts):** They invest in real estate like office buildings, apartments, mortgages, dorms, etc. It's not a matter of appreciation, it's a matter of cashflow (E.g. Students pay rent for their dorms, the cashflow from the rent that students pay is the income that the investors will eventually receive. Why should Rutgers own the dorms? Let someone else own the dorm. And if that dorm is part of a REITs then the investor will get that money.)

There are some REITs that just to get involved in them the minimum investment is $50,000. 

**6. Hedge funds:** Private investors that are pooling their assets to invest in currency, raw materials, distressed companies, etc. Hedge funds are not heavily regulated as the security market but they are very expensive (their fees on an annual basis.)

They are not regulated by the SEC. They are for the rich and wealthy. They are not for the average investor. 

# Mutual Funds 

Good news, there are a bunch of mutual funds to invest in. 

Bad news, there are a bunch of mutual funds to invest in.  

**1. Money market funds:** They invest in short term securities. They are very liquid. They are very safe. They are very low return. It's a year or less. High turnover so you have a lot of access to your cash. You have check writing privileges (minimum check has to be $100.) It's a good resting place for cash. They are pretty safe investment, last time one went back was the financial crisis of 2008. 

**2. Equity Funds:** mutual funds that invest only in common stocks. If you want to invest in common stock but you don't know which one just go with an equity fund because you have people whos job is to decide which stocks to buy and which to not. In this type of fund the primary objective is capital gains. You want to see appreciation, that the price goes up. The secondary objective is dividends if the fund pays dividends. If it pays dividends then it will be passed on to the shareholders. 

**3. Sector Funds:** mutual funds that only invest in sectors like bio-tech stocks, telecom stocks, bank stocks. 

**4. Bond Funds:** mutual funds that only invest in bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, international bunds, etc. The primary objective for bonds is interest. 

There is a bond fund that pays interest on a monthly investment. Who would that benefit? Older people so they have income.  

The secondary objective is capital gains if it happens.

**5. International Funds:** mutual funds that invest in companies outside around the world. 

**6. Balanced Funds:** mutual funds that have let's say bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. They say let's have 70% in bonds, 20% in P.S and 10% in C.S. But they have a meeting and say in 6 months the best place to be is at common stock so they change the balance to 10% in bonds, 20% in P.S and now, 70% in C.S. They don't have to ask your permission to change the balance.                              

**7. Asset allocation and flexible funds:** [insert]

**8. Index funds:** mutual fund that replicates an index. (E.g. There is a Vanguard S&P500 index fund. It is a fund that Vanguard (the investment company) has that copies all of the stocks in the S&P500 index.) It's cheaper to do. 

## How are mutual funds sold?

Someone may come up to you and say "I have a mutual fund for sale."

**1. Distributed by Underwriters:** Underwriters put together and sell the fund, they will try to entice you as an investor to buy the fund. 

**2. Sold directly or indirectly:** XYZ company sells directly to the investors. To sell indirectly, they use a stock broker or brokerage to sell the fund so instead of selling stocks they sell mutual funds.

**3. Use of sales force:** If that same XYZ company has their own sales force- their own sales people. What if the mutual fund does not have a good track record? All the sales force knows that if they don't sell they don't get commission, they don't eat so is it possible that that may sell you something that is not in your best interest because they need to do everything they can do to sell.  
 
## Costs involved in running mutual funds 

Some of the controversies in mutual funds are the costs involved in running them.

**1. Operating Expenses:** [insert]

**2. Front end load:** means you will pay a sales charge at the beginning (E.g. If you invest $10,000 and the front end load is 8.5% then they are taking $850 from you so you're really investing $10,000 - 850 = $9,150 and not the full $10,000. If you do go ahead and invest the $9,150 and after 2 years [it] appreciates to $20,000 then you get the whole $20,000.)

**3. Back end load:** means you will pay a sales charge at the end. (E.g. If you want to invest $10,000, the mutual fund will invest the full amount but if your investment appreciates to let's say $20,000 (and their's a backend load) then they will take a percentage of the $20,000. Let's say the backend load is 10% then they will take $2,000 so you will end up with $18,000.)

**4. 12b-1 fees:** are fees that are used to pay for the distribution of the mutual fund. [expand]

## Example Reading charts

High Yield Bonds are junk bonds. 

Who would buy an investment called junk bond? 

Legally, they can call themselves a high yield fund. 

## Late Trading and Market Timing [Finish Notes]

**NAV Per Share:** tells you how much your investment is worth. They don't do this calculation until after the market closes. 

<RuleBox>
<Latex formula='NAV\ Per\ Share = \dfrac{Total\ Assets - Total\ Liabilities}{Number\ of\ Shares\ Outstanding}'/>
</RuleBox>

**Late Trading:** is when you accept buy or sell orders after the market closes and *then* the NAV is calculated. This is illegal. 

**Market Timing:** is when you place an order after the market closes but you get the price of the market that closed. This is not illegal. 

is when you place an order after the market closes but you get the price of the market that closed. 
 
Stocks vs Mutual Investors - Stocks are traded on the stock exchange. If you want to buy a stock you have to buy it at the price that it is at that moment but for mutual funds you can buy it at the end of the day.

## Taxation of Mutual Fund Income [Finish Notes]

Unless the fund is an ROA or 401K, if you invest in a mutual fund, you have to pay taxes.  

You have to be aware that the interest, dividends, and capital gains have to be paid by the shareholders not the fund.  

[No tax management by shareholders, possible high turnover, finish notes. ]

# Exchange Traded Funds  

Compared to mutual funds ETFs are relatively new.

**1. Investors can trade index portfolios:** [insert]

**2. Can be traded throughout the day:** If tomorrow morning you put an order in, you'll get that price at 10AM you don't have to wait until the end of the day like a mutual fund which is why you have a lot more investors gravitating towards ETFs. 

**3. ETF you can sell short or buy on margin:** You can't do that with a mutual fund. 

**4. ETFs are cheaper:** You don't have to worry about front-end loads,  12b-1, etc. 
 
# Mutual Fund Investment Performance 

**1. Does not show superior performance to market indexes:** [insert]

**2. Evidence is far from conclusive:**

**3. Most of performance less than broad investment portfolios**

# How to find information on mutual funds 

**1. Read the fund prospectus:**  (2)

**2. Wisenberger's Investment Companies:** (3)

**3. Morning Star:** they put all the information you need to know about the portfolio in one page (E.g. Who th fund managers are, what the turnover is, etc. [Insert More])  (1)

# ✨ Practical Information 101 ✨ 

What is the VIX (volatility index)?

When market is shaky, in bad shape, the VIX is going to go up. That's a problem. 

When market is calm, in good shape, the VIX will go down. 

The VIX is a measure of how investors feel, it's a predictor of volatility not which way the market is headed. It's not telling you if the market is going up or down.
