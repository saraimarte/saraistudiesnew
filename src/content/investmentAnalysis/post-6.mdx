As investor you have to make a choice: "How much of the portfolio to place in risk-free money market securities versus other risky asset classes"

# Some key ideas to keep in mind 

**1. Speculation:** when you take a calculated risk based on expected profit. For example, if you are a stock trader and you see that the price of a stock is going up, you might buy it with the expectation that it will continue to rise. This is speculation because you are taking a risk based on your expectation of future events. Unlike gambling, speculation is based on an informed belief about future outcomes.   

**2. Gamble:** when you take a risk with no expected positive return. For example, if you buy a lottery ticket, you are gambling because you have no idea if you will win or lose. The outcome is uncertain and there is no way to predict it.  

**3. Risk-Averse Investor:** you are a risk averse investor if you prefer to avoid risk. For example, you might choose to invest in bonds instead of stocks because they are less risky or in general you might choose to earn less if it means less risk.  

**4. Risk-Neutral Investor:** you are a risk-neutral investor if you are blind to risk- as in your only focus is expected return. For example, you might choose to invest in a stock that has a high expected return even if it is risky because you are only focused on the potential profit.  

**5. Risk Lover:** you are a risk lover if you prefer to take risks.  

**6. Risk Tolerance:** how much financial pain can you handle? 

**7. Utility:** a way to measure how much value or satisfaction someone gets from wealth. For example, if you have $100 and you are happy with it, your utility is high. If you have $1,000 and you are not happy with it, your utility is low. Utility is subjective and can vary from person to person. Helps explain why people don’t just chase the highest return—they consider how risk affects their well-being.

**8. Asset Allocation:** is deciding the types of <Pop t="assets like stocks, bonds, or cash">investments</Pop> to include in your portfolio and what percentage of your total portfolio each type should take up. For example, you might say, "I want my portfolio to be 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% cash." You're choosing your overall investment mix based on your risk tolerance. Other categories may include gold, real estate, or commodities like oil or corn.

**9. Capital Allocation:** is deciding how much of your <Pop t="money">capital</Pop> to actually put into each investment or category based on your asset allocation. For example, if you have $20,000, you might invest $12,000 in stocks, $6,000 in bonds, and $2,000 in cash. You're turning your percentage plan into real dollar amounts.

# The Risk-Free Asset 

<Pop t = "could be you, a bank, a mutual fund, etc."> Risk averse investors</Pop> will usually invest in risk-free <Pop t="investments">assets</Pop>. such as: 

## Types of risk-free assets

**1. Treasury Bills (T-bills):** short-term government <Pop t="investments">securities</Pop> that are considered to be very low risk because they are issued by the U.S. government who have never <Pop t = "aka they have never not paid back what they owed"> defaulted </Pop> and have a maturity of one year or less.

**2. Bank Certificates of Deposit (CDs):** You agree to leave your money at a bank for a set period (like 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc.), and in return, the bank pays you a fixed interest rate. They are considered low risk because they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank.

**3. Commercial Paper:** a short-term loan that a big company takes from investors. It's like Apple saying “Hey, we need $100 million for the next 60 days to cover payroll and stuff. We’ll pay you back in 2 months. No collateral, just trust us.” That promise — written down — is commercial paper. Always matures in less than 270 days (often 30–90 days)

We categorize these assets under the money market because they are short-term and very liquid in contrast to the assets from the capital market (like stocks and bonds) and the derivatives market (like options and futures) which are long-term and less liquid.

## Characteristics of a risk-free (low-risk asset) asset

**1. Low to no default risk:** the asset is considered to be very low risk because it is issued by an entity that has always paid back what they owed. (E.g. T-bills are issued by the U.S. government, which has never defaulted on its debt.)

**2. High marketable:** the asset is easy to buy and sell in the market. For example, if you want to sell a T-bill, you can do so quickly and easily without losing much value.

**3. Very liquid:** the asset can be converted to cash quickly and easily. For example. if you need cash quickly, you can <Pop t = "transfer"> sell </Pop> a T-bill without losing much value.

**4. Very safe:** the chance of default is basically zero.  

**5. Low risk:** the asset does not swing in value like stocks, it's predictable and won't surprise you in a bad way. For example, if you invest in a T-bill, you know exactly how much interest you will earn and when you will get your money back. This makes it a low-risk investment.

**6. Low rate of return or low interest rate:** safety comes at a price. Because risk-free assets are considered to be very low risk, they usually offer lower interest rates meaning you will earn less money compared to riskier investments. 

**7. Short-term maturity:** the asset has a short time frame for when it will be paid back. For example, T-bills have a maturity of one year or less, which means you will get your money back quickly- which again is less risky. 

**8. Fixed income instruments:** meaning you know exactly how much the asset will pay you. For example, a T-bill pays you a fixed amount on a set date and a CD pays 5% annually, no matter that the stock market is doing.

# ✨ Practical Information 101 ✨ 

What is meant by The Bulls and The Bears of Wall Street?

A **bull market** is a market that is on the rise and is economically well. 

A **bear market** is a market that is on the decline- where most stocks are declining in value.  

One explanation for the terms is that bulls attack by thrusting their horns upward, while bears swipe their paws downward.
