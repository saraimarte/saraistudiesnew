# The Behavioral Critique 

-It's an incomplete model- it's still being developed. You need a person who has PHD in psychology and finance. 

-It tries to explain the financial phenomena of why do investors act the way they do (some investors who will invest not because of what the numbers say but because of what their gut feeling is.)

-To do this, you have to understand the psychological traits of an individual. (Story about grandma Mrs. Smith who wanted all her money to invest in options)

-You have to understand what investor biases are (some only care about the return.) There are a number of biases:

**1. Forecasting Errors:** some investors say "the market will have a really low rate of return" and they are wrong. Where did they get this from??

**2. Overconfidence:** some investors are just overly confident and think they are always right. They overestimate their abilities to pick winning stocks. They think they can beat the market. 

**3. Conservatism:** some investors are too slow to update their beliefs in response to new data. They don't act fast enough.  

**4. Belief Perseverance:** some investors form their opinion about a company or a stock and they are going to cling on to this belief for a really long period of time. That's a problem because they're not being flexible to what's happening in the market place. 

**5. Anchoring:** some investors anchor their beliefs to an initial value and the don't change. For example, if they think a stock is worth $100, they will never change their mind about that.

**6. Sample size neglect:** some investors think that a small sample size is enough to make a decision. It's not. 

All of these biases have a lack of flexibility in common. 

## Behavioral Biases 

**1. Framing:** Decisions are affected by how choices are framed. 

**2. Mental Accounting:** when people separate or segregate certain decisions. (Eg. when an investor who is investing in risky stocks but they are near their retirement or an investor who's putting their kid's college fund into T-bills)

**3. Regret Avoidance:** when investors *really* regret investing in the risky stock even if their safe stock goes down as well (Saying: 'you know the job was dangerous when you took it') 

**4. Prospect Theory:** when investors take more risk to create more wealth. This is not necessarily true. You will literally hit a ceiling and then it goes down from there. (Eg. If you go to Vegas and think if you gamble more and more money you'll have a better chance at winning- you won't)

# Arbitrage

<RuleBox>
**Definition** you buy a stock in one market and turn around and sell it in another market at a higher price. This is legal. 
</RuleBox>

## Limitations:  

**1. Fundamental Risk:** You don't have an assurance that you will be able to sell at a higher price. The risk may be that you won't be able to because what if in the meantime something happens in the market itself? 

**2. Implementation** [missed notes]

**3. Transactions Costs, Taxes, commissions**: You may have to pay taxes on the profits you make. You have to pay commissions to the broker.

# Bubbles 

Another aspect of the behavioral critique model are bubbles. 

An example was the Dot. Com bubble. Where you can just order any cat toys you want to buy on a certain companies website. Pets.com. But their financial were really bad and yet there were investors who invested in shares because they said 'hey, there's this thing called the internet so let me invest' This compat went bankrupt. These investors were stuck investing because that company was in the Dot Com bubble. 

Another example is the residential real estate bubble from 2000-2007. There were houses that were $200k and now worth $400k. Eg. There were individuals who bought their homes but lost their jobs. Instead of saying let me do whatever i can to try to pay the mortgage on the house, they took the keys of their house, put it in the envelope and sending it to the mortgage company. When the lending companies received these envelopes they would first shake the envelope and if it jingled they already knew there was another foreclosure. They would call it jinglemail. 

# Technical Analysis 

<RuleBox>
**Definition** Technical Analysis is a way for an individual to try get an idea of what's going to happen in the stock market
</RuleBox>

## Assumptions 

These individuals have certain assumptions:

**1. Past matters:** They assume that was has occurred in the past regarding price and volume will give you an idea of what's going to occur in the future. 

Eg. If a company comes out with new product, and investors like this product, they will buy a lot of that new stock. So this high volume trend in the past, would be a good indicator of a stock price going up to keep in mind now.

**2. Market Value of any good or service:** 

Eg. When you were little in the 90's you used to carry your books. Now, rarely anybody uses hardcover books and instead have PDF versions of them on their computers.

Eg. When you were little in the 50's you used to dip your cookies in the only type of milk there was- whole milk. Now, there's so many different types of milk.

## Advantages of Technical Analysis 

**1.** Not heavily dependent on financial statements (accounting) 

**2.** They don't have to have information first, only recognize movement to a new level. [Ask to expand]

**3.** Technicians invest only when movement to a new equilibrium has begun. 

## Challenges of Technical Analysis 

**1.** Moves may be self-fulfilling, but only temporary  

**2.** Competition will neutralize the value of a technique (they;re not unique)

**3.** Most rules are very subjective and critical values can change over time. (Eg. On the morning of Jan. 20 did you expect all those tariffs to be imposed? No. So that's an example of a critical factor that can change.)

# The Dow Theory

The Dow Theory establishes three types of price movements over time:

**1. Tides:**  Major Trends (Years)

**2. Waves:** Intermediate Trends (Months, Weeks)

**3. Ripples:** Short-run trends (Days)

**Question:** With the tariffs happening right now, where would you categorize what's happening in the stock market right now? 

## Graphs 

Moving Average Line (Short Term 50 days, Long Term 200 days) tells you the way the stock is trending [Insert Graph]

Breadth of the Market Lines - talk about stocks that are moving upwards and downwards. [Ask to expand]

## Sentiment Indicators 

**1. Trin Statistic:** [look at graphs]

**2. Confidence Index:** deals with bonds. It looks at top rated as opposed to low rated bonds. If the confidence index is in the high 90's then it's good news- they are confident. If it's low 80's that's a red flag that means growing concern in the bond market. If it's below 65- that's just red. [look at graph. pg15] You can clearly see that the index is low during the depression and 2008. 

**3. Put/Call Ratio:** [missed notes]

# ✨ Practical Information 101 ✨ 

What are the characteristics of a greet company?

**1. Sound Business Model:** a business model that other people want to copy.

**2. Superior Management:** individuals who know what they're doing. Eg. Satya Nadella is running Microsoft really well. The stock is high. In contrast, the CEO before was Steve Ballmer who was running Microsoft really poorly. The stock was low. 

**3. Significant Market Share:** [missed notes]

**4. Competitive Advantage:** Warren Buffet said companies should have moats that give them a leg up from everybody else. 

**5. New Developments:** What's different that a company has come up with that's different?

**6. Cashflow:** the pandemic showed that those companies who are doing well was because of their cashflow. 

**7. Vision:** what is the mission that management has in terms of where they want to see the company in a few years. When you go to an interview, they ask you "where do you see yourself in five years?" The vision you have for yourself can tie into future developments?
