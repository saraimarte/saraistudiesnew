# Assumptions of the CAPM  

**1. Investors optimize their portfolios based on Markowitz's portfolio theory.**

Markowitz recognized the fact that if you're expecting a certain rate of return, then there will be a certain amount of risk you have to take into consideration and be comfortable with. 

This might sound like common sense but before his findings, people thought that the best strategy in regards to choosing stocks was to choose those that had the best prospects- the most future potential or the ones likely to do well. 

They weren't thinking about how risky those picks were or how those risks added up when you combined different stocks.

His point was that it's not just about which stocks look good- it's about how they interact in a portfolio. Even great stocks can increase your risk if they move the same way at the same time.

Simply, we assume that all investors have diversified portfolios so all unsystematic risk is irrelevant and the only risk that truly matters is systematic- the risk that affects the entire system (market.)

**2. Investors use identical input list for efficient frontier:**  Everyone has the same expectations about returns, risk, and correlations between assets. So they all see the same "menu" of optimal portfolios.

**3. Same risk-free rate for all investors:** meaning everyone can borrow or lend at the same risk-free rate, allowing them to combine the market portfolio with the risk-free asset to suit their risk tolerance. This means that some investors can play it safe by holding more of the risk free asset (like T-bills) and less of the market or if they have a low risk tolerance they can hold more of the market.  

**4. Market portfolio is aggregation of all risky portfolios and has same weights:** when everyone follows the same logic, the combined risky portfolio that everyone ends up holding is the market portfolio. This portfolio includes all assets, weighted by their market value.

# Results of the CAPM 

**1.** All investors will have the same basket of risky assets to invest in (the market portfolio.)

**2.** The only risk that matters is systematic risk.

**3.** The Capital Market Line (CML) shows the best possible complete portfolios that combine the risk-free asset with the market portfolio. It is different from the Efficient Frontier, which only includes portfolios made up of risky assets. The CML starts at the risk-free rate and is tangent to the efficient frontier at the market portfolio- meaning it shows the highest possible return for each level of total risk, including combinations with the risk-free asset.
