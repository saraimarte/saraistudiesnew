We will talk about two sub-sectors in the fixed income market: money market (short-term debt) and the bond market (long-term debt.)

# Money markets (the market of short-term debts)

The money market is a sub-sector of the fixed income market and it covers short term debts like the following, 

**1. T-bills:** are guaranteed by the government and is the investment where you can invest and sleep at night. They are also very marketable. Berkshire and Hathaway buys $1 billion dollars on t-bills every month because they have so much money.

**2. Commercial paper:** short term loans to high quality firms like Apple. 

**6. Repos and Reserves:** a type of loan agreement.

**7. Federal funds:** commercial banks that are part of the federal reserve system they lend each other money. This can be as short term as one night/overnight.  

**8. Brokers' Call:** is when a broker gives a person money to buy stock. (E.g. Stock brokers lending money to their clients.)

# Money market rates
 
**1. Fed funds rate**  
**2. T-bill rate**    
**3. LIBOR**   
**4. Repo rate**    
**5. Call money rate**  

# Money market yields

How are yields helpful?

They help compare between which instrument to use. 
 

## Bank discount yield 

## Add-on interest yield 

## Bond equivalent yield 

## 

## Holding period return 

If you buy gold then distributions for HPR is 0  because youre not getting anything while you hold it-its not generating any income. 

Stock in apple pays dividends / distributions/ income so while youre holding the stock its generating income (dividends) so distributions would exist. 

# The bond market

New type of bond recently called ultra long bond. bonds for 50, years, decades etc. instead of normal 10-20 years, years, etc.

Why companies issue  bonds - 3 aspects. 

# Different types of bonds

A mom wants to send 12 yr old kid to college and wanted to invest in stock market to raise that college money.

Is that a good idea?

No, because anything can happen in 6 years.

The better choice is to invest in t-bills or t notes. 

Mostly t bills because they have even less risk.

For example, the mom can do five year t-bill at the moment her son is 12 years old and then another 2 year t-bill when he is 17. 

The mom also has a four year old- for them it would make sense to put money in the stock market because it's way more than 6 years, the money is likely to grow. 

TIPS treasury inspections protection securities. 
that means interest will always stay the same but principal can be different. 
if inflation goes up then value of principal goes up. viser versa. 

it tries to protect investors aas far as inflation is concerned.

- they get to not pay the rest of the interest 

When a bond is being called back how can it affect the lender? 

-they get the cash/ principal plus interest due at the time immediately   + premium
