In the futures market, there has to be a minimum of two parties involved but each are betting on different outcomes. 

For both parties, a future's contract is a type of investment that will be received at some point in the future (3 months from now, 6 months, etc.) but anything more than a year is too risky. 

Why? Because when you're in the futures market, both parties are betting on the *future* and it's really hard to predict the future more than a year ahead of time.  

# Properties of a Futures Contract 

What type of contract is a futures contract? Forward Contract.

<RuleBox> **Definition:** A Forward Contract requires a party to deliver a good or item at a certain price sometime in the future at an agreed upon price. </RuleBox>

**1.** It's a deferred delivery sale of some asset (wheat, corn, orange juice, jet fuel etc.) with the sales price agreed on today. 

<RuleBox> **Definition:** Deferred sale means the item will be received some time in the future. </RuleBox>

No active secondary market for forward contracts- this means you can't easily resell of trade a forward contract once it's been signed. 

**1.** The contract specifies precise requirements for the commodity to be delivered.

E.g. There are many types of corn. There's even corn *only* for animals and yet there is a market for it. 

E.g. There are two types of chicken. One type for frying (those you see at Kentucky Fried Chicken) and one type for broiling (those chickens you see on the plastic glass squares at Walmart.)

Hence, the contract can't just say 'corn' or 'chicken' it has to specify the type of corn or chicken or jet fuel that will be delivered. 

**2.** Delivery of agricultural commodities is done by transfer of warehouse receipts. 

**3.** The contract specifies which of the two parties has the long vs short position. 

The party with the short position is the one who is selling the good (just remember that both start with s- short, sell)

The party with the long position is the one who is buying the good. 

**4.** variety of goods like minerals and currency can be traded. 


# Mechanics of Trading in Futures Markets 

Okay, you want to be part of a futures markets with another party.  Where do you go? How do you find the other party? Do you have to hunt them down? No!

There's this thing called the **Clearinghouse.**

The clearing house is obligated  delivered the commodity to the long position 

number of long or short contracts outstanding 

 who is the buyer or seller. 



# Properties of the Futures Market 

**1.** The market formalizes and standardizes forward contracting.  

By formalizing we mean putting it on paper. Why? So people don't forget what they agreed to or can lie about what they agreed to.

By standardized we mean it's a type of contract that everybody has used in the past and has agreed too. It has words people are used. 

**2.** It's a place where buyers and sellers can get together and perform transactions. 

**3.** Standardized contracts provide liquidity because many trader swill concentrate on the same small set of contracts  

**4.** Futures contracts are marked to market and can be traded on secondary markets. 

[Insert Summer in Kansas Analogy & Staycation Affect on UnitedAirlines Jetfuel futures contracts. If you know supply and demand you can work in futures contracts.]

# Marking to Market 

**1.** At the start of trade execution, each trader establishes a margin account (put money in the pot [poker analogy]). Initial margin is often between 5% and 15% of contract's total value. 

E.g.  If you're contract is worth $300, then you as a buyer (in the long position) should put 5-15% of $300 as margin at the start. 

**2.** 

Convergence property - is a commodity that can be available in two different markets (like currency.)

## Concepts to be aware of

**1. Cash versus Actual Delivery:** [insert notes]
**2. Regulations:** commodity markets are regulated.  [insert commodity broker story ] [insert transition from stock regulator to this commission]
**3. Taxes:** If you make a profit, you have to pay taxes on that. 

# Futures Markets Strategies 

Just like any type of investment you go into- stock, bonds, etc. you need to have strategies. 

Speculators- you're buying it so you can make money right away  
Hedgers - you're trying to minimize your losses  
Short Hedge - someone who takes the short futures position to offset risk just in case as far as what happens to the sales price.   
Long Hedge- someone who is trying to eliminate risk because of an uncertain purchase price.   

NOTE: The following formulas will not be on final exam. 

# 1 Determination of Futures Price 

<RuleBox> **Definition:** The Spot-Futures Parity Theorem is given the normal or theoretically correct relationship between spot and future prices you can calculate the future price. </RuleBox>

r<sub>f</sub> = [(F<sub>0</sub> + D) - S<sub>0</sub>] / S<sub>0</sub>  

r<sub>f</sub> : risk free rate  
F<sub>0</sub> : Futures Price   
D: Dividends  
S<sub>0</sub> : Current Price / Spot Price   

Does this formula remind you of anything? Yes! The holding period return formula. 

What if you have multiple contracts with different periods? What's the futures price then?

(F<sub>0</sub> + D) = [ S<sub>0</sub> (1 + r<sub>f</sub> - D)<sup>T</sup>]   

T: Contract Maturities Period  

# 2 Determine Future Prices Given Different Multiple Maturity Dates (Spreads)

F<sub>T<sub>2</sub></sub> = [F<sub>T<sub>1</sub></sub>  (1 + r<sub>f</sub> - D)<sup>(T<sub>2</sub>- T<sub>1</sub>)</sup>]   

F<sub>T<sub>2</sub></sub>: Futures price for delivery at date T<sub>2</sub>

F<sub>T<sub>1</sub></sub>: Currents Futures Price 

T<sub>2</sub>- T<sub>1</sub>: Difference Between Delivery Dates 

# Futures Prices versus Expected Spot Prices 

Theories explaining how well does the futures price forecast the ultimate spot price. 

One of these is called the Expectations hypothesis. 

<RuleBox> **Definition:** The futures price is equal to the expected...[insert notes] </RuleBox>

**2. Normal backwardation** is the idea that there are natural hedgers who are always trying to hedge risk (eliminate risk.) (like farmers.) [insert note aboutOld Farmer's Almanac]

**3. Contango: natural hedgers are the purchasers of the commodity rather than the suppliers.**

E.g. Grain Processors [V is in contango use analogy]
