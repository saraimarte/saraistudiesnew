# Introduction 

From the investor perspective, bonds are a good idea because they are a steady source of income.
From the issuer perspective, bonds are a good idea because we are diversifying our portfolio.

# Bond Characteristics 

Simply, a bond is a loan. 

Bond = Loan = Contract = Agreement

When you buy a bond, you are signing a contract that says 'after x years you will pay me back y amount of money and each year I will get z amount of money in interest.'

6 months after you graduate you have to pay 

[Insert Picture]

A Bond -  a picture: 

Top Part - how much interest, when bond matures, who is borrower, who is lender, par value / principal 

Bottom Part - the coupons (interest)

**4. Bond Indenture:** the limitations on how to use the money. (E.g. $50m can only be used to build the new factory. It can't be used to pay bonuses to the management team.) This is made to protect the lender so as a lender you want to make sure that the money is used for the right purpose- that you have a bond indenture. 

Some limitations: 

**Sinking Funds:** [missed notes]

**Subordination of further debt:** the lender is saying to the borrower, "You can't take any more debt because if you do and go into bankruptcy, I may not get paid." Here, the lender is protecting themselves. 

**Dividend Restrictions:** here, the lender and the bond holders are saying, "You the company, can not get paid dividends untitl we get paid our interest."

If you're interested in buying stock ina  company find out what the dividend restrictions are. These restrictions are basically telling the commons stockholders that there is a limit to their dividends. 

**Collateral:** the idea that something is backing up the loan. For example, you take a car loan. What's the collateral?  The car. Another example, a company wants to buy a piece of machinery for $1m and they put that machine as a collateral but the machine is specifically built for that company. The lender has a problem because if the company defaults then the lender takes back the  machine as collateral... that's a problem because they may not be able to resell it since the machine was built specifically for one company. Another example, student loans- what's the collateral? Your degree? Some loans have no collateral. Point is, you have to be aware of what collaterals there are. 

**5. Call Provisions:** when a borrower pays off a bond ahead of time. 

Let's say year 1 you bought a 30 year bond at 8% interest but you sell it at year 7.

Why would a borrower want to pay off a bond ahead of time? Because if interest rates have gone down then the borrower pays off the bond, borrows money instead of 8% they borrow at 5%. 

Why would a lender want this? Should we feel bad for the lender? No, because the lender gets a perspectus that says if the bond is callable, when it's callable, etc. so they know what they got into. 

E.g. SOFI bank refinances student loans at a lower interest rate. 

**6.** Credit Default Swaps (CDS) :  [missed notes] [slide 17 look at graph which ones are safer?] 

Why is it that the premium for a 19 year old males is higher than a 19 year old female

Because the insurance company believe that the 19 year old male is more likely to get into an accident than the 19 year old (because they're more risky.)

**7. Collateralized Debt Obligations(CDO)** [missed notes]

## Zero Coupon Bonds 

Zero Coupon Bonds:** a bond that doesn't pay interest. The second catch is that the government says 'this is a a zero coupon bond. You didn't get any interest payments but if you *did* then that's how much you would have gotten in interest...and guess what? You have to pay taxes on that.' But the good thing is, once you get the money back you don't have to pay taxes on it. 

Why would anybody get involved with something like this? You can use this for retirement (or student loans?) 

## T-Bonds or T-Notes 

Another type of bond investors go with are treasury bonds. 

These bonds are very conservative. 

The federal government borrows the money and they *always* pay it back. They have never defaulted so it's something you can count on. 

Maturity between 10 and 30 years. 

They are issues at denominations of $1000 + (minimum is $100)

They pay interest every 6 months. 


## Corporate Bonds 

These are bonds being issues by a company. 

They can be traded in the NYSE/OTC or they can be held. 

These bonds can be rated by organizations such as Moody's and S&P (just like we get a grade in our class, bonds get a grade too.)


## Convertible Bonds  

Loan to Own  

A convertible bond is a bond that can be converted into stock.

So if you buy a convertible bond, you have the option to convert it into stock if the stock really goes up in value. 

Food for thought: What if Amazon issued convertible bonds? No because Amazon's common stock does not pay dividends. So, if you had a bond that paid interest then you convert it to stock then you now loose all the interest payments. Only benefit is that the stock does appreciate in value.  

## Putable Bonds [missed notes]

## FLoating Rate Bonds 

These are bonds where interest rates vary. 

# Preferred Stock 

It's a combination of two types of financial instruments: bonds and common stock. 

When you buy preferred stock, it resembles a bond because that bonds pay interest and preferred stock pays dividends.

You buy preferred stock not to get wealthy but to get a steady stream of income.

Also, like bonds, preferred stock has no votes (only if company goes down/into bad financial shape.)

At one time, preferred stock had an unlimited lifespan. They were like perpetuities. But now, they have a lifespan like 20 or 30 years.   

Q: Where is preferred stock listed on the balance sheet? 

A: Equity. 

What preferred stock and common stock have in common is that they are both listed as equity. 

Also, when you buy preferred stock, you are not promised dividends just like with common stock. 

### Problems for the firm 

**1.** Dividends on preferred stock are not tax deductible (interest is, but dividends are not).  
**2.** There are types of P.S like cumulative preferred stock which promises to pay a dividend in the future if they miss a dividend payment. That may be a problem for the company.    
**3.** The company may loose common stock holders because firm may get caught paying too much in dividends for preferred stockholders.   

# Investor's Rights 

**1.** Preferred Stockholders have a preference over common stockholders meaning they get paid before common stock holders in case of liquidation. They are a senior security.   
**2.** No voting rights (only when corporation going under)  
**3.** If they don't get paid common stock holders donn't get paid.   

Fact: bonds and stocks were called the Widow and Orphan investments because if someone past away and left a lot of money to a widow or orphan, they would invest in bonds and stocks. Why? Because they have a steady income that will support them. 

## Foreign Bonds: Issue a bond from a country other than the one in which the bond is sold.


# Innovation in the bond market

**1. Inverse Floaters:** let's say if interest rates go down, then the inverse floaters say the interest rates on the bonds will go up and vise versa. 

**2. Asset-backed bonds:** a bond that is backed up by an asset (Eg. a car, a mortgage, etc.) 

Why would a bank want to do this? Because they can sell the bond and get money now OR they are keeping it off their hands (because what if students can't pay because they can't get a job? What if people can't pay their mortgage?)

In other words, liquidation and risk transferance.

**3. Catastrophe Bonds:** it's a way to transfer catastrophe risks (hurricane, tornados, fire, etc.) from the issuing firm to the capital makrets. 

The bond holders are going to receive compensation for taking on that risk in the firm of higher coupon rates.  

**4. Indexed Bonds:** a bond that is somehow connected to the price of a commodity (Eg. oil, gold, etc.)


When you're talking about bond returns you have to be concerned about, 

**1. Interest Rates**  

[Insert Graph]  
Interest Rates goes up, bond price goes down.   
Interest Rates go down, bond price goes up.  

Why? 

E.g You have a bond that pays $50 a year (5% coupon on a $1,000 bond).

Now interest rates fall — say, from 5% to 4%. New bonds being issued now only pay $40 a year.

So suddenly, your bond is a hot item — it pays more than the market!

Investors who want that higher income will pay more than $1,000 for your bond to get that better return — maybe $1,050 or $1,100.

That’s why when interest rates go down, bond prices go up.

# Bond prices over time 

There's nothing wrong with buying bonds, but if you are buying them for reasons other than steady income, so to make a profit the following are things you have to be concerned about: 

**1. Yield to maturity** [missed notes]

**2. Yield to call** [missed notes]


**1.** To purchase a bond that will make a profit, an investor must buy he bond below par or face value. 

**2.** When bond prices are set according to the present value formula, any discount from par value provides the capital gain you are looking for (anticipate).

**3.** When yields fluctuate, rate of return on investment will change as well. 

**4.** An increase in bond's yields will reduce it's price. 

## Investment Grade Bonds 

Three characteristics you have to look at when dealing with investment grade and junk bonds:

**1.** Quality of the bond: how likely is it that the borrower will pay you back?
**2.** Risk of the bond: how likely is it that the borrower will default?
**3.** Interest Rate: how much interest are you going to get?
**4.** Rating 

Investment grade bonds:   
**1. Quality:** High    
**2. Risk:** Low     
**3. Interest Rate:** Low    
**4. Rating:** High  

Junk bonds are bonds that are rated below investment grade. They are rated below Baa or BBB.

**1. Quality:** Low    
**2. Risk:** High    
**3. Interest Rate:** High    
**4. Rating:** Low
