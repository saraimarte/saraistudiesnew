# The Efficient Market Hypothesis 

<RuleBox align = "left">

The **Efficient Market Hypothesis** says:

"You can't consistently beat the market because prices already reflect all available information hence the market is efficient"

</RuleBox>

# Assumptions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

The following are conditions that the EMH model is based on. 

Note that these aren't just pulled out of thin air- they come from what we've actually observed about how markets work. Researchers noticed a few consistent patterns and built the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) around the following realities:

**1.** There are many <Pop t = "investors, hedge funds, traders, algorithms"> participants </Pop> constantly analyzing wanting to make the most profit.

**2.** New information comes in random fashion so no one can predict the future perfectly.

**3.** Investors react immediately as soon as that new information hits- making the stock price move right away. 

All this goes to show the source of an efficient market is **competition** because in efficient markets there are participants competing against each other to make the most profit and if they get information early they make sure to act on it before others find out.

# Versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis 

The EMH has three versions that differ in the type of information they consider: 

**1. Weak-Form Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Prices reflect all past prices and trading volume. This means that **technical analysis** (using past prices to predict future price or charts) won't work.

**2. Semi-strong-Form Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Prices reflect all publicly available information, including past prices and financial statements. This means that **fundamental analysis** (using financial statements to predict future prices) won't work.  

**3. Strong-Form Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Prices reflect all information, both public and private. This means that even insider information won't help you make money. 

Notice the pattern is that whatever information is available to the public is information you won't be able to use to predict future prices- to beat the market.

# What Does This Mean for Investors?

If markets are efficient, then trying to outsmart them doesn't really work long term because again: 

Technical Analysis doesn't work if under weak-form. 

Fundamental Analysis doesn't work if under semi-strong form.

Insider Information doesn't work under strong-form. 

**Active Management** is the process of hiring people to research and pick stocks, or actively doing it yourself. 

It doesn't work in the semi-strong and strong forms because all the good news is already reflected in the price.

**Passive Management** is the process of investing in index funds or ETFs that match the performance of the whole market. Since prices already reflect known information, this approach avoids unnecessary trading and keeps costs low.

The takeaway: EMH encourages low-cost, passive investing because if prices already reflect all available information, then trying to actively pick winning stocks or time the market is a waste of time and money. Instead of paying high fees for active managers or obsessing over short-term trends, it makes more sense to invest in diversified index funds that mirror the market- keeping costs low and returns consistent.

# Some people disagree that markets are perfectly efficient. Some say there is a...

**1. Magnitude Issue:** even if inefficiencies exist, they are too small to notice but they may still be real and we're ignoring them. 

**2. Selection Bias:** the data we use to test the EMH is biased because we only look at successful investors and ignore the failures. We study only the strategies that work and not those that didn't. 

**3. Lucky Event:** some people do beat the market but what if it was just luck and not based on actual skill?

These are good points, but the inefficiencies they raise are very small. So even if EMH isn't perfectly true, it might still be true enough to guide how most people invest.

# How do Researchers Test the different versions of the EMH?

## Weak-Form Testing and Results

**1. Statistical Tests of Independence:** this is testing that that the security returns over time should be independent of one another since in weak form we assume that information comes randomly so every return a stock incurs should indeed by independent of one another assuming the efficient market hypothesis.  

**2. Autocorrelation Tests:** is testing the significance of positive or negative correlations relationship between in returns of different stocks overtime. If you believe that the capital markets are efficient then you should see insignificant correlations fro all kind of combinations of investments. 

**3. Runs Tests:** these are studies that have confirmed the independence of stock price changes over time. The results show that there really no pattern as far as determining what happens and when prices changes as far as stocks prices. Stock prices are literally independent of what happens now, a few months ago, and a few years ago. 

**4. Tests of Trading Rules:** these are studies that have compared risks and returns derived from trading rules simulations. You're testing certain trading rules that have been achieved and tried or used.  

**5. Filter Rules:** this is when an investor trades a stock when the price exceeds a filter value that's set for it. 

## Semi-strong-Form

**1. Time series analysis:** this is testing if we can predict future stock prices using publicly available information- these studies have not worked in the short term hence supporting the semi-strong EMH where you can't beat the market using public information. Instead the best estimates of future rates of returns will be for long-run returns.  

**2. Event studies:** tests the affect of an event on a stock price or shows how fast stock prices change to significant economic events. This is important because then an individual can determine if an investor will buy the stock on the margin or short the stock. If your'e assuming a semi-strong-form EMH then you hope these tests show that stock prices react fast to economic events. Yet, there are certain types of rates of returns that are abnormal, very good or very bad, what event occurred?  

For example, the market crash of 2008, this event occurred because you had mortgages that were a disaster and investors in the market place panic hence the market taking a huge drop.    

**3. Adjustments for Market Effects:** securities rates of return can be adjusted for the overall market rate of return. As an investor, you can say "I'm looking at a stock but i'm going to adjust the rate of return on that stock up or down based on what's happening in the market." In other words, this shows that the stock price is not independent to what happens in the market because the market is an outside factor that affects the stock price.  

**4. Return Prediction Studies:** have resulted in the idea of **Risk Premium Proxies** which shows that there is limited success in predicting short-term returns hence it's better to focus on long-run returns. 

These studies have also shown that looking at the **Quarterly earnings reports** for companies may give you an idea of how well the stock is going to do.  

**5. Calendar Studies:** the stock market crash of 1929 and 1987, happened in October. These are studies that show there are certain times of the year where you can predict where the market is going to go.   

**6. Predicting Cross-Sectional Returns:** if we're assuming an efficient market, all securities should have equal risk adjusted returns because security prices should reflect all public information that would influence securities' risk. 

## Strong-Form

**1. Major Groups of Investors:** 

**1. Corporate Insiders:** individuals who work within a corporation are either buying or selling stock. This means something because they may have access to inside information.  

**2. Stock Exchange Specialists:** these are individuals on the floor of the stock exchange that are buying and selling shares to try and maintain the price at a certain level. This means something because they have to make sure that there aren't any wild fluctuations in terms of prices.   

**3. Security Analysts:** these are the individuals who analyze and report on securities but are required to report if they or their family members own the shares or not. This is important because they can go on the news and just promote the stocks they or their family members own but if the news clarifies that they own a stock for example, then individuals will be more open to the idea that maybe their report on the security is biased.

**4. Performance of professional money managers:** if these managers are buying significant number of shares it can have an impact as far as the company is concerned.     

# Is it Possible to Beat the Market With the Help of Mutual Fund Managers and Analyst Performance

**1. Mutual Fund Managers:** Some mutual funds do well (or poorly) for a while, and they tend to stay that way for a bit. So there's some evidence that performance isn't always random, but it's not strong enough to fully dismiss EMH.

**2. Analyst Performance:** Some analysts do outperform the market for short periods. But once you factor in <Pop t = "taxes, brokerage fees">trading costs,</Pop> those gains often disappear. So just following analyst tips doesn't guarantee profit — even if they're technically “right.”

# ✨ Practical Information 101 ✨

What is meant by Objectives and Constraints of <Pop t = "investors for a mutual fund, pension fund, insurance company or bank, etc.">Institutional Investors?</Pop>

**1. Mutual Funds:** by law mutual funds have to state what their objectives are. Maybe their objective is concerned about what bonds they're investing and what return they will get but they also have to state what their constraints are (what they can't do). Maybe they can't invest in stocks or in preferred stocks, etc. This is important because as an investor you may be considering this mutual fund but if the fund does not invest in stocks for example you may believe that the constraint is too heavy and it will affect your return.

**2. Pension Funds:** the objective is to get pension income to the pensioners but the catch is where is that income coming from? From mortgages, preferred stocks, bonds, commons stocks that pay dividends? But maybe they can't invest in options or derivatives. 

**3. Insurance Companies:** are regulated by the state not the federal government. Their constraints are the rules imposed by their state. 

**4. Bank:** their objective is to pay their clients a certain sum in terms of interest but there are things they cannot do for example be involved in options since they're very conservative.
