# How Securities are Traded

When you buy something you place an order. Similarly, when you want to buy a security, you want to place an order. 

Now, there are different types of orders. 

## Types of Orders

**1. Market Orders:** If you place an order with a broker to buy a stock at exactly that time, that's a market order: "I want you to buy the stock right now"

**2. Price Contingent Orders:** If you say to a broker, "I want you to sell or buy stock at this particular price. If you can't do it then cancel the order." 

## Trading Mechanisms 

**1. Dealer Markets:** If you want to buy a Ford you won't buy it from the manufacturer Ford- you'll buy it from a car dealership.  

**2. Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs):** Participants can post market and limit orders over computer networks. 

**3. Specialist Markets:** if you go to the NYSE there are specialists on the floor that specialize in specialize stocks like Nvidia. 

## NASDAQ 

Level 1 : Regular investors like you and I who will receive inside quotes, tend to be investors not actually intending to buy or selling securities. All they want is information on curtain prices.   
E.g. If you go to a retail store and someone comes up to you and asks "Can I help you with anything?" and you say "I'm just looking". 

Level 2: Subscribers receive all bid and ask quotes but they can't enter their own quotes.   
E.g. Brokerage firms that are getting this information for their clients but they're not placing an order.   

Level 3: For firms dealing in securities, they maintain inventories of a security and they're ready to buy or sell. 

Summary: For the first two levels is information gathering. It is at level three where transactions start.  

## NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)

There are different ways you can trade securities, 

**1. Block Sales:** Usually insurance companies, hedge funds, mutual funds, Institutional Investors, Warren Buffet (10b shares of Coca-Cola). It's selling large number of shares. 

**2. SuperDOT and Electronic Trading:** enables NYSE firms to send market and limit orders directly to the specialists over computer lines.  

**3. Settlement:** an order executed on the exchange must be settled within three working days (does not include holidays or weekends.) The buyer has to deliver the cash in three days and the seller has to deliver the security within three days. The security actually goes to the brokerage and they hold the securities and the stock certificate if security are shares.  

# New Trading Strategies 

**1. Algorithmic Trading:** the use of computer programs to make trading decisions. These trades exploit many small discrepancies in security prices like a penny in shares, half a penny a share, etc. The key here is volume. Doing algorithmic trading with large volume of shares. It also does rapid ross market price comparisons.     
*2. High Frequency Trading:** the idea that trading occurs but at a very fast rate. You can have a program set up that trades in milliseconds. Again, this makes a difference with large volume.       
**3. Dark Pool:** a trading system where participants can buy or sell large amounts of securities without showing their hands- their face, identity. There is no transparency. Buyers and sellers in these dark pools are hidden from the public and the trades are not reported.      
**4. Bond Trading:** You normally associate a bond with the buy and hold strategy. E.g. If you buy a bond in year 1, you hold it for 30 years. Why? To receive the cash flows (the interest). Now, a lot of investors that are buying bonds so they can set up particular strategies as far as when they're going to sell the bond. They're not buying bonds to get the interest but to make a profit by selling them.    

# Market Structure in Other Countries 

**1. London Stock Exchange** 

**2. Euronext:** merger of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussel exchanges. later on it merged with the NYSE group in 2007. This is an electronic trading system. We're talking about the execution of orders without brokers.  

**3. Tokyo Exchange:** it's the first exchange that wakes up in the morning. Then Europe one opens, then closes then NYSE opens then close then Pacific stock Exchange.  

# Trading Costs

When we're talking about the idea of trading- it depends on who you are. 

Brokers are a party that will buy or sell a stock for their client. 

There are different types of brokers for different types of investors. 

**1. Full Service Broker:** they have a full array of service they can offer such as tax advice, investment advice, legal advice, estate planning, wealth management, etc. E.g. for investors who have no idea what to do with their money like a cardiologist who knows everything about the heart but nothing about money. 

**2. Discount Broker:** they are just an order taker. You only go here if you know what they're doing. They are not allowed to give you advice. If you want to buy 1000 shares of IBM you can just go there and say so and they'll take your order. All they will do is buy and sell stock. They won't tell you "oh thats a great/horrible investment." They are cheaper than a full service broker (Charles Schwab.) You can call them and put in an order in to buy or sell. CS can provide information but can't give you advice. 

**3. On-line Broker:** Charles Schwab has an online app where you can buy or sell stocks with 0 commission so they take nothing. So easy, right? But you have to know what your'e doing-what stocks to buy. If not, your'e screwed.

# Buying on Margin 

Buying on margin really means buying stock on credit. 

E.g. You are being lent the money by master card to buy jeans. You are not paying the full amount for the jeans, master card is lending you the money to do so.  

Here, you are buying stock in a company without putting up the full amount. The broker through the bank is [insert].

If you look at Costco today, it's $700+. Last year it was $1000+ but maybe last year that amount seemed so expensive and you couldn't afford them. Now, you can if you buy on a margin. 

If you play poker, you have to put money in the pot to play. 

Similarly, in investing, you have to have margin in the account, money in the pot, skin in the game or else you can't play. 

**Step 1:** How much money you put in.   

**Step 2:** How much money you're borrowing from the broker.  

**Step 3:** Broker will borrow that amount from a bank (not out of their own pocket! This is risk management because as a broker you want to minimize possibilities of any losses.)  

**Step 4:** Broker charges client. [insert]

**Step 5:** Securities are kept with the brokerage  firm. If you buy 1000 shares of COSTCO, the securities don't go with you, the brokerage firm holds them because they don't trust you.  

**Step 6:** Current initial margin requirement: generally 50% each client and brokerage. Sometimes it can be higher like 60%, 70%, 75% etc. But if the market is cool then it can be below 50%. Who sets the initial margin requirement? The FEDS.

**Step 7:** Margin call if needed: you buy stocks in margin because you're expecting the price of share to go up. For example, COSTCO, generally always goes up but what happens if it goes under in value by a lot? The brokerage can actually sell the shares needed to make up the difference by putting more money into the account. If the value is supposed to be $100,000 and it's at $80,000 then you either have to give them $20,000 or they will sell $20,000 worth of shares (Edit.)

**How far can the stock price fall before you get a margin call?**

[insert math]

## Advantages 

**1.** You're buying the stock without paying the full amount. You experience the full benefit of ownership. 

**2.** Investors can sell the stock. E.g. If you buy a stock for a $100/share and it goes ip to $150/share, you can sell it and make a nice profit after paying the brokerage house, transaction costs, maintenance costs, etc.  

## Disadvantages 

**1.** You're expecting the stock price to go up for COSTCO but what if somebody comes around and literally knocks out COSTCO? Now, the investors have a problem, they have higher downside risk.  

**2.** Investor could loose security because of margin call. The brokerage could sell their shares to make up the difference in value.   

**3.** You always have to worry about the stock price going up.    

# Short Sales

Short sale is selling a stock you don't own.  

If you open up a brokerage account and say you want to do a short sale you can but there are certain rules you have to follow. 

**1.** Investor can profit from security price's decline: if you feel that the stock is overvalued, and it's reached it's peak and there's only one way it's going and it's down, you can just short the stock. 

You can go to a brokerage and say, "I want to short a 1000 shares of xyz stock."

Let's say the stock is $100/share. You feel like its overvalued, its not the correct price. You think the correct price is $1/share. 

What do you do?

You're borrow the shares from the brokerage. 

You sell the shares at a $100 each and then once they get to $1/share then you buy them back again and return the stocks. 

**How much can a stock price rise before there is a margin call?**

When you short a stock, your nightmare is that the stock price goes up instead of down like you thought. 

## Advantages

**1.** If stock price goes down. 

## Disadvantages

**1.** You have to replace the shares and pay the lender.  

**2.** What if you guessed wrong? What if the stock price goes up?

**3.** You have to post margin with the broker - meaning you have to put a certain amount in the pot- a certain amount of margin.  

**4.** Possibility of margin calls.

# Regulation of Securities Markets

[Use small dog w teeth vs big dog w no teeth impact]

Securities industry is heavily regulated. 

**1.Securities Act of 1933:** made it so that you can get a perspectus, key information about a company before you made an investment. Yet, it had no teeth. 

Laws should have teeth. Securities Act of 1933 did not have teeth. It was all bark.

**2. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934** is the body that makes sure that the rules and regulations of the securities act of 1933 are followed. This law added the teeth. They enforced the laws and punished if not followed.

**7. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board:** they can look at and oversee what accounting companies do.
