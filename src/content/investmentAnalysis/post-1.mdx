# Financial markets and the economy 

There are many factors that play a role in the financial market. 

**1. The informational role of financial markets**: The market will react to the economy. If the economy is good, investors invest. If the economy is bad, investors pull back (Eg. 2008 financial crisis, Covid Pandemic). 

**2. Consumption timing:** Understanding when consumers are most likely to spend is crucial. For example, during periods like Christmas or Black Friday, consumer spending increases significantly, benefiting the companies they purchase from. Recognizing these patterns helps anticipate market activity.

**3. Allocation of risk:** As an investor, you have to be aware of how much risk you can tolerate. For example, if a person is 70 or 80 years old, they cannot afford to take risks because their sources of income are no longer stable. However, we still have about 40 years until retirement and will have stable jobs. We *can* afford to take risks.  

**4. Separation of ownership (those who own common stock) and management (those who manage the stocks):** Owners of stocks take more risks and hope for a high return over a long period of time. Managers of stocks *also* want a high return over a long period of time but at the same time they don't want to get fired! Hence, they make sure to not take more risks than the company can afford because that could mean the end for the company. So, they are less risky.

**5. Corporate governance and corporate ethics:** Have you ever wondered why professionalism is a huge part of corporate life? There are so many rules as to what you wear, what you can say, can't say, how to behave, etc. Those rules are put in place to make sure you don't make the company look bad. Why would that matter? Because of reputation. If companies have bad reputations it's more likely no one will invest in them. 

# The Investment Process

There are two major elements in the investment process:   

**1. Asset Allocation:** There are different types of assets to invest in. There are fixed income assets, equity, natural resources (Eg. gold, copper), fashion (Eg. Herm√®s Scarves), art (Eg. paintings, statues.) As an investor, you have to find the right balance.   
**2. Security Selection:**
