# Financial markets and the economy 

There are many factors that play a role in the financial market. 

**1. The informational role of financial markets**: The market will react to the economy. If the economy is good, investors invest. If the economy is bad, investors pull back (E.g. 2008 financial crisis, Covid Pandemic). 

**2. Consumption timing:** Understanding when consumers are most likely to spend is crucial. For example, during periods like Christmas or Black Friday, consumer spending increases significantly, benefiting the companies they purchase from. Recognizing these patterns helps anticipate market activity.

**3. Allocation of risk:** As an investor, you have to be aware of how much risk you can tolerate. For example, if a person is 70 or 80 years old, they cannot afford to take risks because their sources of income are no longer stable. However, we still have about 40 years until retirement and will have stable jobs. We *can* afford to take risks.  

**4. Separation of ownership (those who own common stock) and management (those who manage the stocks):** Owners of stocks take more risks and hope for a high return over a long period of time. Managers of stocks *also* want a high return over a long period of time but at the same time they don't want to get fired! Hence, they make sure to not take more risks than the company can afford because that could mean the end for the company. So, they are less risky.

**5. Corporate governance and corporate ethics:** Have you ever wondered why professionalism is a huge part of corporate life? There are so many rules as to what you wear, what you can say, can't say, how to behave, etc. Those rules are put in place to make sure you don't make the company look bad. Why would that matter? Because of reputation. If companies have bad reputations it's more likely no one will invest in them. 

# The Investment Process

There are two major elements in the investment process:   

**1. Asset Allocation:** Asset allocation answers the question, "Where should I allocate my money?" There are different types of assets or categories to invest in. There are fixed income assets, equity, natural resources (E.g. gold, copper), fashion (E.g. Hermès Scarves), art (E.g. paintings, statues.) As an investor, you have to find the right balance.   

**2. Security Selection:** Security selection answers the question, "In those categories, what exactly should I invest in?" For example, in the fixed income category you can choose between investing in a U.S Treasury Bond or Municipal bond. In the stock category, you can choose between investing in NVIDIA or Tesla. In the natural resource category you can choose between investing in gold or copper.

# Markets are competitive 

**1. Risk-return trade off:** The more risk you take the more return you can expect. The less risk you take, the less return you can expect. 

I say expected return because sometimes someone can take a huge risk and expect a great return and yet not receive it. 

An example my professor gave: If you have ever seen Jurassic Park you know that the guy in charge of the park was hoping for people to pay to see dinosaurs be brought back to life. He took a huge risk in bringing dinosaurs back to life and expected a great return (people paying thousands to see them) and yet did not receive the return because things went wrong and the dinosaurs escaped!  

**2. Efficient Markets:** Markets are efficient because they react to news. To good news and bad news.

# Recent trends 

**1. Globalization:** Investors have recently been investing in companies *outside* of the U.S. 

**2. Securitization:** 

You are a financial institution that issued $100 million worth of student loans. 

Students are paying these back over time with interest, but you don’t want to wait 10-20 years to collect all the money. 

You decide to securitize the loans to turn those future payments into cash now.

To securitize the loans means turn them into securities like bonds!

You bundle those $100 million worth of student loans into a single package. These loans are all generating regular payments from students.

You take the loan pool and divide it into tradeable pieces called securities, which represent rights to the payments from the students.

Then you sell these as bonds to investors. 

Investors see this as buying the future cash flows and earning more with interest payments and you see this as getting the money upfront so you can move on and do other business deals. 

**3. Financial Engineering:** Investors are hoping to go into certain financial arrangements that will give them a higher rate of return. [Ask him to expand on this]

**4. Computer Networks:** Computer networks help give access to important information and data that helps investors make better decisions. 

There is this practice of categorizing stocks by their market capitalization.

**Market Capitalization** is the total value of a company's shares of stock. 

The categories are as follows, 

**1. Mega cap** $200 billion and over (Microsoft, Apple, Meta)  
**2. Large cap** $10 billion and over   
**3. Mid cap** Between $2 billion and $10 billion  
**4. Small cap** Between $300 million and $2 billion  
**5. Micro cap**  Under $300 million (Startups)

Now, why would this be useful information to investors?

If an investor can't afford much risk then they would stay away from the micro and small cap stocks and focus on the mega and large cap stocks like Mircosoft stocks. intuitively we know Microsoft stocks are less risky because everyone knows microsoft has established itself in the market compared to startup that was founded a year ago and can go bankrupt any second.

Why would mega and large cap stocks like Microsoft or Apple not provide as much of a return as a startup would? Because they have grown to a size where their growth potential is more limited. They might still grow, but at a slower rate, because they’ve already captured a significant share of the market. 

If an investor can afford risk and wants to have a much higher potential return then they would focus on the small and micro cap stocks like startup stocks.
