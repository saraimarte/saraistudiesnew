In recursion problems, we have recurrence relations. 
<RuleBox>
**Def.** A **recurrence relation** is an equation or inequality that calls itself with smaller inputs. 
</RuleBox>

For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

<Latex formula="F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}" />

F(n) is a recurrence relation because it calls itself to define it's value.

Recall, that a recurrence relation describes how a problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

But we want to know how much time this will take.

In other words, we want to be able to go from a reccurence relation of an algorithm to the time complexity of an algorithm.

Reccursion Algorithms at the end of the day take two of these two forms: 

The recurrence relations for most algorithms you'll encounter follow one of two patterns: 


<Latex formula="(a) T(n) = \sum_{i} r_i T(n - c_i) + f(n)" />

<Latex formula="(b) T(n) = \sum_{i} r_i T(n/c_i) + f(n)" />

i is the counter for the subproblems  

r<sub>i</sub> is the number of subproblems, 

c<sub>i</sub> is the size of each subproblem, 

and f(n) is the cost of dividing the problem and combining the results.

**You:** Uh, you just said reccurence relations either look like (a) or (b), but earlier you said this: 

<Latex formula="F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}" /> 

was a reccurence relation but... it doesn't look like either of those forms. So...

**Me:**  Your're right! But we can get it to look like one of those forms.

So I should say that most reccurence relations can be written in either form (a) or (b).

The question is how?
